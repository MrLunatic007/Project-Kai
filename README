Project Kai - A Personal Reasoning Assistant 🤖

Kai is an advanced personal assistant, inspired by JARVIS, is designed to provide intelligent, context-aware, and personalized responses. Built with a hybrid architecture combining rule-based reasoning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning, Kai can understand, reason, and generate human-like text while adapting to user preferences over time.

Features ✨

    Context-Aware Conversations:

        Maintains conversation context for coherent and relevant responses.

        Uses short-term and long-term memory to recall past interactions.

    Hybrid Reasoning Engine:

        Combines rule-based logic with neural reasoning for better decision-making.

        Detects reasoning types (causal, deductive, inductive, etc.) to tailor responses.

    Reinforcement Learning:

        Learns from user interactions to improve response quality.

        Uses rewards to optimize conversation flow and engagement.

    Dynamic Memory Management:

        Stores and retrieves important conversation snippets.

        Automatically retrains on memory data for personalization.

        Prunes outdated memories to maintain efficiency.

    Lightweight Architecture:

        Optimized for resource-constrained devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi).

        Uses subword tokenization and model quantization for efficiency.

    Progressive Training:

        Adapts learning rates dynamically during training.

        Incorporates memory-based retraining for continuous improvement.

Architecture 🏗️

Kai AI is built on a modular architecture with the following components:

    Memory Manager:

        Manages short-term and long-term memories.

        Calculates memory importance and relevance.

        Automatically consolidates and prunes memories.

    Reasoning Engine:

        Hybrid system combining rule-based and neural reasoning.

        Enhances responses based on detected reasoning types.

    Transformer Model:

        Lightweight transformer for text generation.

        Trained on user data for personalized responses.

    Reinforcement Learning Module:

        Uses a neural network to optimize responses.

        Rewards are based on response quality and user engagement.

    Preprocessor:

        Handles text tokenization and embedding.

        Uses subword tokenization for efficient processing.

Setup Instructions 🛠️
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8 or higher

    Required libraries: numpy, torch

Installation

    Clone the repository:
    bash
    Copy

    git clone https://github.com/MrLunatic007/Project-Kai.git
    cd 'Project Kai'

    Install dependencies:
    bash
    Copy

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Download or prepare your dataset:

        Place your dataset in the data/ directory (default: data/dataset.csv).

        The dataset should have columns: input (user query) and output (assistant response).

        use the script.py and panda.py files to clean the datasets

    Train the model (optional):
    bash
    Copy

    python main.py --train --data data/dataset.csv

    Run the assistant:
    bash
    Copy

    python main.py

Usage 🚀
Starting a Conversation

    Run the assistant:
    bash
    Copy

    python main.py

    Interact with Kai:
    Copy

    You: Hello, Kai!
    Kai: Hi there! How can I help you today?

    Exit the conversation:
    Copy

    You: exit

Training the Model

To train the model on your dataset:
bash
Copy

python main.py --train --data data/dataset.csv

Customizing Kai

    Memory Settings: Adjust memory limits in memory_manager.py.

    Reasoning Rules: Add or modify rules in reasoning.py.

    Training Parameters: Tune learning rates and epochs in trainer.py.

Example Conversations 💬
Casual Chat
Copy

You: Hi Kai!
Kai: Hello! How's your day going?

Reasoning
Copy

You: Why is the sky blue?
Kai: Because of Rayleigh scattering! Sunlight gets scattered by the atmosphere, and blue light scatters more than other colors.

Personalization
Copy

You: I love pizza.
Kai: That's great! What's your favorite topping?
You: Pepperoni.
Kai: Got it! I'll remember you love pepperoni pizza.
