SocialMediaUser,UserComment,heathrow to belfast with british airways. boarded about  noon for . take off. after some delay we were informed there was a technical fault and engineers had been called. we were offered water or soft drinks initially. we finally took off at pm which meant we had been sitting on the plane for  hours during which time we were not offered anything at all to eat. it was quite disgraceful for ba. once airborne we were served tea / coffee / alcoholic drink and a choice of potato crisps. is this what ba has been reduced to? this airline definitely no longer lives up to expectations and i will not be flying with them again. at least with low cost airlines you can at least buy some food.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | well where do you start. this is a business seat on a supposedly premium brand. the ticket price was in excess of . the lounges at lhr t need work. yes british airways are investing but long overdue. the small lounge for b gates needs to be re-thought and offer better food options. to the aircraft - its been refitted apparently	 but should be scrapped. the seats remain tired. the vanity screen was not working properly. the entertainment system is past its best	 with smudges and scratches. the carpets look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeed. the toilets are old. overall	 the aircraft is well past what could be described as a premium. regarding the crew - they have been bashed and are a shadow of their former selves. sad but true. too many apologies for the rubbish decisions of management. on this trip the galley kitchen was poorly stocked and many of the usual items were missing e.g. waitrose fruit and yogurts. they have also stopped the ice-cream. food served was not good - saving grace was the meat platter	 but what could you do to spoil sliced meats and cheese. blankets are faded and ragged. the toilet bags are a joke. cheap and nasty. this route was the jewel in the airline crown and one that has slide down the priority ladder. ba need to invest in a new fleet. re-energise the crew. change the catering and get a few more choices. upgrade the seating and change seating configuration to avoid being an olympic pole vaulter.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | flight at .am from dub to lcy cancelled pm night before. no text message. no phone. waiting at bus stop and randomly checked email to see alternate flight option. hang on? whats this! it was dark at am. it was hard to see mobile phone screen. im still jet lagged. only option was to lhr at .am. tried calling. no one there. so accepted it. but i didnt see the day change! it was the next day! i didnt want the flight (as was staying at docklands hence choosing lcy but thought i better take it as its leaving an hour after the original flight. nope. i better call to say hey sorry i screwed up. your flight is not going to work for me. i dont have any more accommodation in dublin and i dont want to waste one night in london. called. the most surly customer service (can you even be called that when you treat people like this) answered. she kept calling me james (not my name). she was brutal. you accepted it. i cant do anything. she basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion i accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer. she kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen. but if you had called us we could have put you onto a aer lingus flight! why didnt you call? you are at fault. just so callous and uncaring. she wanted to charge me  pounds in new flights and change fees. i said nope and booked a flight today with ryanair. plus i need to find my way from gatwick to docklands. more money from me because of bas utter contempt for their passengers. ive been flying qantas for  years and they can do some funky stuff. but never this level of cruelty because of one simple error. never again. how do people accept such utter contempt and ineptitude? welcome to the u.k.! just wow.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,not verified | i booked my flights to the uk in may  and had to cancel our trip to the uk on march 	//	  and because i am older and have pre-existing health conditions	 my doctor asked me to postpone our trip. the british airways customer care associates i talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundable. now the problem is	 i need to rebook and use the travel credit by may  for travel to the uk by may  or lose all the credit from our trip. how can i make travel arrangements by may  with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? i understand ba has policies in place	 but i cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with covid-. i feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline	 my preferred airline is still british airways. british airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter	 because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers	 remember	 there are many other airlines out there to choose from. the coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. i guess the bottom line is i think british airways needs to put some common sense to their policy. i want to rebook and travel	 but i am hesitant to this at this time. hopefully	//,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | gatwick to faro. pretty good flight all round	 and as ticket was bought in sale with car hire as well	 it worked out good value. check in area at south terminal is very nice and i was checked in very quickly	 with fast track security equally quick. the new ba lounge is really well decorated and laid out with lots of nice and varied seating	 interesting light fixtures and good views of the tarmac. it was early morning and breakfast was served	 which was reasonably good. although the hot options were just bacon roll	 omelette roll or porridge which felt quite limited. staff were all excellent. boarding was quick	 cabin crew friendly although no pre flight drink at all offered. this was an older aircraft with the old style seating	 but the aircraft was clean and didnt show much sign of age. the seats are comfortable enough	 although legroom is not amazing. i was lucky enough to be in the front row so had more than most. the cooked breakfast was actually fairly good i think	 nothing world shattering but decently cooked and fairly good quality ingredients. disembarkation was quick enough	 although bags took quite a while. priority baggage didnt seem to count for a lot	 and annoyingly my priority bag tag had come off and ended up being one of the last bags. overall a good flight.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | british airways use a version of the  with a minimal number of economy seats on this route from london heathrow to johannesburg. every seat on both outward and return flights was occupied. they make a bigger profit by having more seats in business class etc and so squeeze the economy class people into a confined area. seats are narrow	 seat cushions are hard	 and i had a large person next to me both trips. i paid for an aisle seat in each case but comfort is impossible. food was passable and no more	 but there were two meals on the long flight. cabin crew were surprisingly young and seem to be in training - polite and efficient but they had obeyed the instruction to disappear for most of both flights. both flights on time. these ancient s are showing their age even though both of these had been revamped they looked tired but clean. the alternative aircraft used on this route is and airbus  but a fellow passenger said that the seats were even tighter on that aircraft. it is tiie that ba started to compete and not be so complacent.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,ba krk-lhr  may - a new sector launched just early this month and my first time flying ba. i was pleasantly surprised (for my friend) that he was able to check-in his big carry-on for free while i paid for check-in luggage. i understood why in the end. my biggest gripe has to be that the sunday flight departs and arrives late into lhr. this was worsened by the fact that it was a full flight but the overhead bins were already full before all were on board hence there was a  minute delay on the tarmac as remaining hand-carry luggage had to be put in the hold. unfortunately flight did not manage to catch up while in the air hence we landed  minutes late cutting it close to the curfew time for lhr. we had to run all the way through and almost missed the last heathrow express train. i will never fly a late flight into lhr again. that said the pilot and cabin crew were entertaining - quite chatty over the pa and with some passengers though not necessarily friendly to all customers. . hours on an a passed by without any in-flight entertainment (to be expected for regional flights) and with some food and refreshments (which were good).,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,british airways are not interested in providing normal business class comforts and cuisine or even lounges on some routes. the cancun route and the nassau routes i have flown recently show this clearly as they are presumably are not bothered with little or no competition at all. this saddens me that they have made a clear decision that on holiday type routes they will provide the absolute minimum on everything. one example that shows how pathetic it has become with cutbacks out of many problems i encountered on these routes is that the food was so awful on the cancun flight recently that we merely asked for cheese and biscuits in business class to be told that we could only have one packet of two biscuits each as ba only allocated one packet per person. the staff all agree that this was pathetic! no lounges at both these airports either and queuing of business class and economy all together no attempt to really show you paid extra for your ticket.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,recently returned from mauritius to gatwick in club world and have to say that the service was woefully lacking. left on time. the cabin crew were obviously tired and the welcome glass of champagne was served without smiles or a welcome. throughout the whole flight the crew did the absolute minimum and there was very little interaction with the passengers. breakfast was disgusting and served soon after take-off. a little round casserole dish of british breakfast ingredients all piled together and searingly hot and overcooked and tasteless. awful insipid coffee. after that some of the crew disappeared for a sleep and we were left to ourselves. nobody asked if we wanted anything nobody chatted i rang for a drink and nobody came. the galley kitchen/snack bar was almost bare and had two manky stale smoked-salmon sandwiches and a few bottles of water. on asking for a glass (there were none) for wine i was told to sit down and one would be brought as indeed it was ten minutes later with no smiles or nibbles. throughout the flight i felt guilty asking for a g&t or wine because of the negative attitude of certain cabin crew. lunch was just about ok and very good wine. after that for the next five hours nothing was served to refresh us before landing - no tea no cakes no nothing. the seating configuration was -- (boeing ) and packed in like sardines - claustrophobic for some. to access the aisle from the window you have to climb over the legs of the person behind and the food is served across the lap of the aisle seat over the partition. we were a couple but if you are travelling alone it could make for some very strange eye-to-eye contact with a stranger. the ife was dated and a very limited choice with poor quality fuzzy screens. the whole package was so minimal soulless and lacking. not once were you made to feel special or pampered in any way. if there is an alternative in future to ba ill take it and compared with some middle-east airlines the club world product is embarrassingly mediocre. ba needs to refresh review and up-date quickly. sorry ba - youve lost me for the foreseeable future!,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,not verified | as a spanish born individual living in england	 i have been using british airways for over  decades	 multiple times a year. on th january  i booked a flight for my son and i to go to alicante. however	 i was informed on the th january  by my doctors that i am unable to fly due to an elbow operation i have had. as a result i decided to give my ticket to my daughter	 calling up the customer service team for british airways to make the change. on the th january  they took my enquiry call. there seemed to be some speech delay in the call	 which presented a small bit of difficulty	 however i also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. when requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name i was told this is not within the policy	 and that i would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. i was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. i accepted this and was then asked if i would like to cancel the booking. i insisted i would need to know the total of the refund. its lucky i did ask to check this	 as i was then informed it would be roughly .. the total cost of my booking was .	 which comes to . per passenger	 leaving my refund total at less than % of the value of my purchase. this is despite the seat not be abandoned. according to ba policy	 all i am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than % refund even when im buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago).,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,the real issue with all discussions about the israel arab conflict is that the scale of the conversation is never wide enough. it requires a macro historical perspective on top of micro. this conflict is literally thousands of years old. some arab cultures and their religious perspectives have matured out of the historical conflict and are able to live side by side with jews. the basis of the conflict goes all the way back to abraham	 isaac and ishmael	 and then jacob and esau. the conflict and its ingredients are baked into the context of the entirety of that historical pie from the times of abraham until present. when you consider the conflict in its entirety you can come to glimpse that there is no land or money or compromise possible. the only resolution will come when one side completely wins and the other is completely obliterated. the jealousy and hatred is cooked in. ishmael was rejected by abraham	 and jacob finalized that rejection when esau sold away his potential inheritance and jacob received it in his stead. the descendants of both brothers are aware of this reality. over eons the conflict has presented in complicated and twisted ways	 but the root of it stems from chosen and rejected and biblically good vs evil. so it doesnt really matter what pierce or tate or anyone who pontificates about it says. it seems complicated	 but it really all boils down to the roots. it will not end until there is a complete winner and a total loser.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,bangkok to london heathrow.  sep . on this flight british airways stinted on everything. i dont mind a frugal airline as long as the fare is cheap. british airways is not cheap. as soon as we were in the air the temperature plummeted. everyone had their airline blankets over them. there were not enough stewards/stewardesses. forty minutes before the welcome on board drink - and no small snack not even a small packet of nuts. seatback tv did not work in the section i was on and the man next to me had to move to another seat. the seatbacks should be checked before the flight. however eventually they did work. a small number of films tv shows i have never heard of and no games option. first meal very frugal second meal no salad and no bread roll. and creamers! even for tea! whatever the quality of the meal serving creamers cancels out any pretence of quality. snacks we had to wait and when they were available there was a limited amount. british airways even ran out of beer! ba hasa system of paying to book a certain seat they dont miss a trick! i resent having to pay to book a certain seat. the flight was expensive but it had a good time slot and no stopover. never again.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,i wish i could comment on the service on the aircraft	 but with a  hour delay i am unable to and can only comment on the ground service after being informed the aircraft was delayed because of a technical fault. it is not the technical fault i am worried about but the way the problem was handled by bas ground staff at johannesburgs or tambo airport. the cabin crew had arrived at .hrs and boarded the plane which was due to depart at .hrs to london. at .hrs the announcement came that the flight was not boarding and passengers should wait to be escorted to the arrivals areas to collect baggage. the chaos then started. people close to the boarding desks sought to find out information and the possibility of alternative flights (which were fully booked). after about  minutes passengers were told to go to arrivals where ba staff would be there to assist. got to arrivals	 nobody was there to even tell passengers which carousel to go to. a series of late announcements then informed passengers to collect luggage and go to the arrivals area to seek hotel vouchers. nobody was directing passengers at each stage. passengers were congregating under an electronic sign that said south african airways domestic transfers to collect vouchers. the line slinked back into the arrivals area. only two service agents were dealing with all passengers. chaotic scenes. no line for families or premium passengers. in the end no vouchers were given and free for all to just know which hotel to go to. no clear announcements given at any stage to passengers. all airlines have issues which mean a plane will be cancelled - it is how the issue is dealt with that shows professionalism and a basic duty of care to passengers. in this case there was nobody in charge	 nobody undertaking line management and nobody providing one source of information. a true shambles. passengers arrived at the hotel not knowing when the aircraft would leave (scheduled to leave  hrs after original departure) or what the real problem was (rumours only). flying club and having a ba gold card (with gold list status) meant nothing.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | dubai to london heathrow. its bad that ba requests additional payment to select seats before the check-in. if flying solo its not a big issue	 but with any companion (in this case i was with my son of ) it would have been an issue to be separate. this also means that if there are  or  flights	 and a group of two (as in my case) the difference would be substantial	 up to approx $. lucky enough at least on the return flight we were able to select the middle seats because the flight wasnt full. on board service was decent. professional	 courteous and friendly attendants. toilets in the second half of the flight werent too clean. flat seats in business class are outdated but comfortable for a nice sleep. the aircraft did not have wifi.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,doh-bah-lhr-lax flight started from doha with a short hop to bahrain to pick up more passengers. check in was ok but was over baggage allowance by  kilo so made me pay. flight departed on time with an older  with broken ac so everyone was roasting inside the plane not good in a very hot middle eastern summer told it would be better once airborne - had to endure twice due to stop over in bahrain. crew were fantastic though very welcoming the moment i stepped onboard compensated the lack of ac. dinner was served and it was good nothing to write home about as was breakfast. ife old with no avod capabilities so movies are on the loop and few channels with old movies. arrived at lhr terminal  - nice very quite very early in the morning so few people and shops around. flight to lax again on an older  but new ife with avod this time crew mixed bag male crew a bit rude. food - lunch was ok like the dessert but small portions bring lots of food and  hours before arrival a sad sandwich and yoghurt was serve other carriers serve full meal as second meal or snack and around that time ife crashed on half the plane nothing to do about it good thing it was almost arrival time pretty boring flight and full as well arrived on time and bags were out in  minutes that is if you can come out of immigration faster. it was an ok long flight very disappointing but it did get me where i wanted to be.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,this conversation appears to be heavily influenced by emotions	 particularly those expressed by andrew tate. its important to recognize that emotions can cloud our judgment and make it difficult to consider all perspectives objectively. while criticizing the actions of hamas is important	 its also crucial to consider the broader context of the conflict and the potential differences in goals between hamas and the palestinian people as a whole.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | i am a regular traveller on many airlines and a one world emerald ff. british airways flight ba from lhr to athens on th september was by far the worst cabin crew that i have encountered in  years of flying. the crew had no interest in the interests of passengers in business class	 and were more interested in chatting with each other in the galley area. after . hours in the air	 we were offered a drink	 the champagne was undrinkable	 and the crew gave me a gin and tonic. after that they did a meal service and served a fish dish that had been overheated and again was inedible. that was all the service we received on the whole flight of . hours. no top up of drinks no offer of water	 and again the cabin crew spent their whole time in the galley eating and talking. i even went out and asked them was there any service on this aircraft	 and received no reply,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | glasgow to london gatwick with british airways. absolutely ludicrous approach to carry on baggage allowance on this flight. i arrived at my seat as the plane was only approximately a third boarded and already the overhead lockers in the  or  rows either side were jammed to capacity with huge bags that could not possibly have came even close to the permitted size allowed for a cabin. i struggled to squeeze my jacket into a gap between  massive cases and had to keep my small backpack containing only my change of clothes between my feet for the flight. no idea how how such visibly oversized and overweight bags were allowed onboard but it made for a pretty uncomfortable flight. pretty disappointing from an airline whose standards seem to be sliding badly.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | gatwick to tirana. i was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight	 because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers	 there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class	 and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat	 to three seats behind me. . the seats were the same seats you have in economy	 the difference being that the middle seat is empty	 thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats. i encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that i had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. you are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. flight left on time and landed early. british airways have in my opinion the best inflight w-fi service. for  pounds you get unlimited	 very high speed wi-fi where you can stream youtube videos. they offer cheaper packages as well where you can get unlimited texts.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | london to hamburg. baggage self-check-in was diabolical ... machines were either slow or not working. boarding commenced early	 resulting in on time departure. seat for this short flight was quite comfortable and better than most european carriers. however the total lack of any kind of refreshment was poor. i dont expect a meal but even a drink of water would have been something. crew were friendly and the flight on time.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | british airways continues to go downhill. we flew business class and the experience was like economy from  years ago except you can have a glass of champagne. we were packed in full x seats because of it issue the day before. even if werent	 the seat pitch and width is the same as economy. gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style. the food was dreadful. the in flight service was unsophisticated. ba used to have an acceptable european business class. they dont any more. other european airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. ba is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. how i miss the politeness of old ba business class from around  years ago	 how i used to look forward to it	 the small gestures like hanging up a coat	 giving you a hot towel	 having nice food	 being served from the galley	 rather than from the manky trolley. covid is not the reason - this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,doha to london via bahrain with british airways	 and a very poor lounge in doha. even flying first class on ba there is no reciprocal arrangement to access the excellent qatar airways lounge. instead there is a lounge for all other airlines. on boarding my wife and i were ushered to our seats. and to our amazement our individual lockers were opened by the flight attendants who promptly disappeared without making an offer to hang our coats or jackets	 as is standard practice on even business class. no hot towels before take off or landing	 very average menu	 and as we slept through dinner were keen on breakfast. told that due to possible turbulence coffee could not be prepared	 both our cutlery earlier wrapped by the crew were delivered without spoons to eat the very soggy muesli. orange juice tropics a quality. we had to ask for marmalade with our toast. all the crew displayed little perception of customer needs	 made the more marked by qatar airways business class crew who were absolutely excellent on the earlier sydney to doha flight. poor food	 very poor crew awareness	 or attention to detail	 who seemed to be going through the motions. slightly aloof. way below the  gulf majors in flight attention. however bed was very good	 as you would expect. amenity kit below the qatar airways business class kit	 and a joke in comparison to qatars first class kit. very agreeable cabin and seats	 but crew performance at economy class performance. would avoid again.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,my mothers flight from london to moscow was cancelled. while understanding that these things happen	 and accepting this inconvenience	 it is the customer service of british airways that i found outrageous. first of all	 british airways would refuse to speak to me (paying customer)	 as they had incorrect data in the ticket purchase details - despite the fact that i had any proof they may need	 and all contact details in the ticket purchase data were mine. but fair enough	 there is more. they couldnt speak to my mother (she doesnt speak english	 they dont speak russian)	 and while i was trying to offer various options to customer service agents	 time passed. by the time (several hours later) i suggested their moscow office calls my mother to confirm her identity	 it was too late - moscow office was closed	 and all was offered is for my mother to call then next day. needless to say	 she had to travel next day	 and it was unacceptable option. so	 at no point my mother was offered anything required by regulations /	 articles 	  and  - so ba appears to be in breach of those regulations. i bought a ticket for my mother with aeroflot instead	 for a flight at a similar time to that cancelled by ba	 and asked ba for refund. ba in turn (and after my mother travelled to moscow) demanded a letter of authority from her	 otherwise they would refuse to speak to me. they would not	 for example	 call my mother in moscow and simply ask her. my mother sent me letter of authority	 which i forwarded to the ba. now they would speak to me	//	 ( days after - regulations state that refund must be made within seven days) i chased this with ba. i was promised a refund and compensation again. as of today ( november )	 nothing was paid to me yet. customer service responds with generic messages	 themed we are sorry for the delay	 the refund will be with you soon. my requests are simply ignored. so	 while it might be a reasonably comfortable airline when everything works well	 i would encourage everyone to very seriously consider how you will be treated in an event of a delay or cancellation. in my experience	 the treatment was appalling.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,dont ever fly with british airways! we went cancun for our honeymoon	 and on the way there they seated my husband at the opposite end of the plane - only  hours of being married. when we arrived in cancun our bags didnt make it there	 so we had to wait  days for our bags and go out and buy some clothes. travelling back they lost them again	 so not only did they lose our bags once but twice and had to wait  days again for them. i advise anyone reading this to not waste your money.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | london to san francisco return in economy. the seats are small. outbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat and it was horrible. im only  and female but couldnt lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings. if you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you	 you will need to do some major maneuvering. touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable. i flew on a  both ways. they no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm. i had to ask them to turn up the a/c both ways. i was literally sweating. economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of business class. asian vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible. asian vegetarian breakfast in economy plus is much better. i will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights. its not worth it.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,this makes me sad. if piers  attacks and tries to dominate tate	 i m not surprised that the majority is silent. i couldnt face piers	 i wiuld say whatever he wants to hear and leave me alone. im not surprised that the majority of people let this wars rage on. we are weak and scared,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,london heathrow to miami return with british airways. delay outbound and back with poor communication of both. told of a delay which was extended once we reached the gate and on the return journey and then again once on the plane. service on the return journey seemed like stewards were going through the motions rather than worried about the level of service. i does seem that the british airways flights to miami and back to london heathrow have very poor punctuality when alternative airlines dont have the same issue. inflight entertainment on inbound flight not fully working after a reeboot which was done because some passengers had no service for the first hour.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,we flew with ba on th february to goa - had three flights in all starting at manchester. on our outbound journey we were upgraded to premium economy which was fantastic! very comfortable food was much nicer. on our way back we were in economy. as a family of  we were split only by an aisle but it is much nicer to all sit together. our youngest was awfully sick i think as a result of turbulence as well as sleep deprivation. bless the steward who cleaned it up. however we were sat for  hours with the after effects! nothing anyone could have done however. staff always very friendly and nothing seems to be any trouble. would certainly fly again with them but this next time the prices have rocketed. not as much room in the economy and when seats are reclined theres little room. the passenger in front kept putting her hands over the back of her head rest which then covered my tv screen - i had to keep moving them off. just one bit of advice for the stewards - make sure during meal times you are vigilant in ensuring that passengers put their seats up!,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,is piers morgan representative of israel . i think an anchor should be neutral 	 am i wrong?,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,not verified | ive had to book six flights with ba recently. all have either been cancelled or had a significant time change. the latest flight was so late into heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though wed scheduled around  hours between flights. ba staff at heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part. they couldnt get us to our destination within  hours of our scheduled arrival time. we booked an easyjet flight from gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to gatwick. a complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far. perhaps ba have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment. its an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,london heathrow to cape town. check in at heathrow t very efficient. used my card to access the ba lounge at t which is pretty average	 although enjoyed a good supper with very good claret so did not need to eat on plane. boarding a bit of a mess at remote gate  where both the pa and aircon were not working	 but nonetheless everyone seemed to be seated before the inevitable missing passenger/bag offload	 which caused a min push back delay. service seemed efficient on board (although i did not eat dinner) and we had a friendly young crew member on our aisle. managed to get some rest and with enjoyed breakfast before landing at cpt	  mins late. all in all	 reasonable value for money. the usual hopeless british airways ife which needs constant re-sets and is from the age of the ark.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,lhr - ist. t efficient as usual no queues at check in or security. proceeded to the lounge where we relaxed and watched planes take off with glass of champagne. boarded on time cabin crew friendly food was excellent and of course more champagne! the only thing that ba need to do (which i believe they are). is to retire these old aircraft. the overall product is excellent but i think the cabin crew are let down by the ageing planes.

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | full flight from muc to lhr with british airways. on the plus side the ground and cabin crew are very friendly	 so is the baggage allowance	 plane although not new was clean. you have to pay for your food and beverages on board short haul flights. the departure was delayed by  minutes and a further delay on arrival for a total of  minutes later than expected. we also parked at a gate at the very far end of t. the plus side of all the walking was that the luggage was there waiting for us. service as expected for the price and that would be the reason for choosing them again. when traveling with an infant the delays tend to compound matters.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,a good flight from heathrow to stockholm. busy and chaotic boarding as didnt board by row number. therefore boarding took forever and with an excess of hand luggage	 flight was then late. on board meal now a bag of crisps or biscuits but i know that by january even that will have gone	 thereby relegating ba to a low cost airline. not surprised mind you	 as they have to compete with the others	 but ba will need to keep their prices keen. female crew were as friendly as ever. males less so.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,flew heathrow - madrid return. have always been loyal to ba but no longer. t lounge overcrowded poor range of food rubbish and uncleared crockery and glasses everywhere - not particularly pleasant. bags not tagged priority. fast track not fast. service on board to madrid was exceptionally good and old style ba. return bags not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with no attempt at service beyond handing out. very disappointing experience and unacceptable. could not select seats on-line for return flight as computer had allocated them. eventually seats changed when called call centre - told couldnt be done for half an hour and strangely as the conversation moved forward they could do it. waste of time and energy. practically everything suggested as part of the club europe package didnt happen. club europe used to be so distinctive and worth and i always felt it was worth the premium price. to be honest i have cheaper alternatives from closer airports which i will now be using for my regular flights to and from spain.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | gatwick to lima return in business class. no choice of seats until hr before the flight unless you paid extra (i understand their desire to reward frequent flyers but paying +pp per flight if you arent is just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz). by the time we were able to check in	 there was only one option left if we wanted to sit together. new ba lounge at lgw smart but packed out at the start of easter holidays. limited food offering at breakfast - no hot food at all	 unless you count lukewarm pastries. fa service on flights in both directions was good	 though outbound the cabin lights were switched off for the entire flight between meal services	 despite it being a day flight. food and drink were fine but nothing special - some choices not available by the time they got to us. seating layout of -- in business class is very cramped	 especially if the flight is full - the highest-density seating ive ever experienced in business - and there was no surface to put anything on unless you had your tray table open. small drawer at your feet. recommend the window seat next to the bulkhead if youre travelling solo - no legs to climb over! lie-flat seat was comfortable though for a short person. ife was poor compared to competitors - hard to angle the screen appropriately with a limited choice of movies available. on the way home we didnt mind a long layover at lim as we thought we could use the lounge. no such luck - we couldnt be checked in all the way through from lpb so had to pick up luggage	 go through immigration again and wait several hours in a hot airport with hardly any seats before ba staff appeared to check in the flight home. only seat choice available again were two together on the aisle side of a middle pair. very fortunate not to have anyone in the other middle seat next to me	 otherwise it would have felt very intimate with a total stranger! havent travelled long-haul with ba for several years and can only describe it as a functional	 value service	 even in business	 though its not cheap. id only use ba again if they were the most convenient by a long way (as happened here for a direct flight from london)	 or for a great price on short-haul. theres really no comparison to emirates long-haul offering in business.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | london city to dusseldorf return	 flights operated on behalf of ba by eastern airways. the cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceases. cabin crew must of been members of the basil fawlty school of catering. the outward flight there were  passengers in the business class cabin and the onboard menu was handed out to the three of us. the young stewardess took our orders	 then we heard a crash as the young stewardess promptly dropped one of the meal and told us that the aircraft only had two meals and asked for a volunteer to give up their meal. the meal was of a reasonable quality and well presented. on arrival at dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal. the arrivals boards in the airport say terminal b and we were dropped off at terminal c. our delivered to terminal c and we had to walk to terminal b if you were been met. the return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that ba is becoming famous for at overseas airports. check in did not open until  minutes before the fight to lcy and  hours before the flight to lhr. i can see that this was a money saving wiz by the ground handling agents at dusseldorf. as the flight to lcy may only have max  pax and they would of been able to see the flight loading the day before. the check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on club europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle. which looked totally out of place in uniform. the flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with  pax and only  meals	 which meant that  passengers were offered a so called ham & chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better days. again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airlines such has wizz and ryanair	//,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | bangalore to london. ground experience not great - at lhr automated bag drop didnt work and it wasnt clear why; slow-to-react assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to india needed to be validated. at blr	 no online check-in available and slow process. plane decor extremely run down and shabby	 various pieces of the interior trim (bulkheads etc) rattling and latches for bassinet shelves not locking. row  so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent	 however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing; the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided. seat itself could have more width (i kept bumping the vod control and im quite slim)	 recline limited and footrest could extend more. no usb power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age. vod itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats)	 low resolution	 visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies). to top it off	 on outbound leg the vod stopped working altogether and resisted many resets. customer service forms were handed out so i await the outcome of that. food volume ok	 quality poor (scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible!)	 plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound	 cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg. insufficient lavatories for premium economy and economy.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | london heathrow to geneva return. appalling airline. the booking process is dreadful - they charge if you want to change seat in economy	 i have been told they will be charging for food and drink from january	 and the website very difficult to use. their customer service via phone or email is abysmal (they are extremely rude	 give completely wrong information	 and i have been cut off	 given wrong numbers and put through to loop messages). whilst some of the cabin staff are lovely	 many are extremely unhelpful. this week a steward refused to help me put my cabin bag in the overhead locker (the bag was not oversized	 but i have a bad back at present	 and i asked him very politely) - yet he outright refused though he helped other people. i flew club class a month ago and the fold out table was filthy and even though the steward saw it he ignored the wet coffee rings and salt scattered everywhere and i had to actively ask him to clean it. which he did	 but with very bad grace. i avoid british airways if i can	 but sometimes the flight routes and times fit best with my needs. and every single time i do fly with them	 i am reminded why i dislike them so much.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | this flight from copenhagen to london heathrow was british airways	 but operated by jet time	 who are operating some ba services on the lhr-cph route this summer. the aircraft was definitely not up to ba standards - old	 very worn inside. cabin service i cannot comment on as fortunately i had  seats together so slept most of the flight. i really hope this is a temporary move on bas part as this really is not the standard i have come to expect from them on this route.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | choose a budget airline	 the magic of our national carrier has gone. we have always chosen british airways as our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher premium for the once great service but now its on par or lower than other low cost carriers. firstly we didnt get any priority boarding with our two young children. easyjet provides this. secondly	 we reserved seats as travelling with our two children	 they both fight for who is going to sit at the windows. on boarding we were told the plane has changed	 therefore we now had assigned seats. thirdly	 after paying over  for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife i needed the loo	 first class was out of bounds. so the only option the rear of the plane	 however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past (i guess those drinks they were selling had the ba executive team seeing many  so me being a customer needing the loo was second in priority). after a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past	 but once out they had gone back to the middle of the plane. a crew member at the back galley even laughed and said your not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea. our flight from heathrow to bergen was only an hour and 	 but i spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member. the return flight the cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my  year old grandmother and technology. the safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in  and to top it off	 the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof	 asked the crew - cabin crew	 seats for landing. the captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight	 even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward as we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with that landing. all minor points	 but they were the points we enjoyed with ba	 points that made us choose them	 small points that made the difference. the pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them	 the cabin crew that always went over and beyond. the free drinks that made us feel special to ask and get	 id rather pay a premium for all that or choose a budget airline. gutted our british airways national carrier has become a budget airline. perhaps cost savings are needed	 but for now	 although we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture	 they need to cost save some more to make up our future tickets and my recommendations are now also dead. for me their usp was their service	 without that there is no longer a point.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | london heathrow to paris orly. i have been a gold member of ba over  years making approx  flights per year we have been through ash clouds	 strikes	 it breakdowns and weather and of late the spiral of poor response has picked up pace. i didnt think it could get worse but it did. arrived at the airport and my app said on time	 screens said on time but my independent tracking app said  hours delay. in the first class lounge i was told short delay. knowing how inaccurate ba can be i asked to speak to special services. one hour later i asked again. i got an arrogant manager who lectured me that she was only two on duty	 take it up with alex cruz and there were more important flyers like royalty and celebrity. unimportant is how i felt after  years of gold guest list. she then told me the flight was cancelled and said i would have to either accept the flight the next morning or make my own arrangement .staff didnt know how to get people out of the airport and despte flights on time for charles de gaulle no alternative was offered. i had to concede and cancelled critical business discussion and then beg ba for a refund which they tried to sidestep. the moral of this story is when your gut tells you trust has gone believe it and at ba it is systemic lack of honesty and transparency and it all points to the ceo. the other interesting fact is i did look at choices before booking including easy jet < pounds air france  pounds and foolishly i felt loyalty meant something. not at this airlin . the salt in the wound is that easyjet and af got to their destination on time and no doubt executives on those flights are enjoying a good business day in france. it is incredible that one airline who carrys the british flag is such a disgrace. i am sure that a small percentage are satisfied but looking at the chaos and disbelief in the lounge last night echoes the most common phrase heard in airline speak. what has happened to ba and we wont fly them again.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | prague to washington via london. british airways has turned out to be the worst airline i have flown. unfortunately i am forced to fly them often from prg	 if i want to connect on their one world partner aa	 which i have exec plat status with. ba charges for everything	 including water. prg-lhr is on a small business class seat (same as in economy)	 dried up breakfast that was tasteless	 flight attendants that could not care less and when i asked for coffee told me they were landing soon ( mins before landing) and that i should have thought of it earlier. london to washington was on a broken down 	 seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floor. had to be moved twice before they found functioning seat. food was dried up beef with red that gave me a headache after two sips. entertainment system has about  movies	 compared to about  options on aa flights. overall horrible experience. the extra added costs for flying over lhr and paying extra tax is ridiculous. ba	 what is it about your flights prg-lhr	 with your onboard luggage allowance only? they charge usd  for a checked in luggage even to emerald partners? horrible food	 aircraft	 lhr and transfer experience. good luck ba	 will avoid at all costs. included a picture from the bathroom which was broken.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | boarding at mumbai was chaotic and badly organised. once on board the crew announcements were professional	 relaxed and informative in typical ba style. the seat was quite comfortable. it was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good. i was lucky that the middle seat was empty so i didnt suffer from the new narrow seat which i think would have made it a lot less comfortable. the ife is excellent	 responsive and good quality. there is an enormous selection of tv and movies and a good number of games. wifi is also very good not quite netflix quality but still reasonable and i dont think . for full flight is bad value. you can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging. cabin crew were very good. friendly and efficient. catering was reasonable although on a near hr flight	 the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasnt really enough. landing and processing at heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was am	 even though it was :pm! no queues or waiting at all. even the baggage was super quick at coming through. overall a very solid experience in economy. significantly better than it used to be.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,bangkok to london heathrow.  sep . on this flight british airways stinted on everything. i dont mind a frugal airline as long as the fare is cheap. british airways is not cheap. as soon as we were in the air the temperature plummeted. everyone had their airline blankets over them. there were not enough stewards/stewardesses. forty minutes before the welcome on board drink - and no small snack not even a small packet of nuts. seatback tv did not work in the section i was on and the man next to me had to move to another seat. the seatbacks should be checked before the flight. however eventually they did work. a small number of films tv shows i have never heard of and no games option. first meal very frugal second meal no salad and no bread roll. and creamers! even for tea! whatever the quality of the meal serving creamers cancels out any pretence of quality. snacks we had to wait and when they were available there was a limited amount. british airways even ran out of beer! ba hasa system of paying to book a certain seat they dont miss a trick! i resent having to pay to book a certain seat. the flight was expensive but it had a good time slot and no stopover. never again.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,on a recent vacation from sacramento to paris some friends and i had a terrible experience with another airline and had some trepidation about our return flight from paris to sacramento. we did however choose british airways for the return flight and none of us had flown with them before. i am happy to report that the experience was totally different. our flight was delayed by an hour which did effect our layover and did rush us to our next flight but we had a cushion of  hours layover so we were ok. on the flight the seats were more comfortable more leg room less noisy better entertainment due to screens on seats in front of you and the access to the bathroom was much easier to navigate. we also had seats relatively together which the other airline refused to offer us even though we had made the reservation months in advance. their screen was so far ahead i couldnt see it and it offered only one choice. the staff was very kind to hydrate us frequently and gave us plenty to eat and it was all very palatable. i will definitely recommend british airways for international flights to my friends.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | belfast to seoul via london heathrow. pretty poor. short haul connection to london was good	 before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long haul. flight from london was very cramped	 im slightly above average height but by no means a giant and i really struggled to get comfortable. seat was too narrow	 very little leg room and the space to put my feet was taken up by what i assume was the processor for the ife system for the seat in front. the seat was very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around  hours. the food was ok	 nothing special. not very much of it and the thimble of drinking water you get every few hours is hardly enough. as a child i remember the food on ba flights being very good but something has gone terribly wrong. staff are one of the few things ba has going for it at the minute	 one of the few things left from the ba of old when it was actually worthy of the name. friendly staff on the flight and in the airport. flew the same route with qatar airways a few months before and they were quite simply in a different league. one last note	 you build this terminal  which is meant to be world class. firstly there is no smoking area	 although were constantly being told not to smoke many people still chose to. you expect people to wait in your terminal for hours on connections and we cant even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilets are an unofficial smoking area as youre normally met with a wall of smoke when you walk in. i am not someone who can walk into an airport and buy a rolex and a gucci outfit	 like most people. i recommend you set up some shops where normal people can actually afford the things in them rather than just window shop.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,april  lhr-sydney (via singapore). i flew first as part of a promotion for no additional cost with purchase of business seat on syd-lhr leg. i really enjoyed the concorde room at terminal  lovely meal great service and very elegant space. in terms of the flight the fa were very friendly and helpful on all legs. they went out of their way to make you feel special and a guest. food was very good as was wine offering. seat was comfortable and roomy although there is a lot less storage then in cx business seat. in fact while there is a lot of room much of it really is not that useful. at night fa did disappear for much of the time and didnt really come around (except once) to offer water/juice. whereas on sq economy fa would check on you regularly throughout flight. while of course it is very special to fly first next time i would be just as happy to fly cx business which i think is really great value for money and the seats are just as or maybe even more comfortable. if i had paid full fare for this flight i think i would have been questioning the value for money.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,: piers what you felt after asking this question is what tate is talking about. its very clear your beliefs on the subject conflicted with his	 now imagine that at the elite level. im not agreeing with tates takes but i can formulate my own reasons why they would pursue the guy. he seems to challenge most of the things done at that high level and since he has a big platform he poses a threat since he can reach many individuals around the world. also	 what he said was true	 sexual assault or human trafficking is an easy one way ticket to having your reputation tarnished and once youre branded as such its almost impossible to get rid of. murdering someone is also another brand thats impossible to get rid of but that would be harder to prove and theyre also trying to just get rid of this guy permanently	 not just tarnish his reputation. pretty good interview overall piers	 even when you both had disagreements you both had good perspectives.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | gatwick to rome return. outward flight the plane was full. booked and paid for an aisle seat	 but no legroom and narrow seat. did not eat on the aircraft. landed on time. return flight left rome late	 again full. this time i booked and paid for aisle seat near emergency exit - more leg room. food on the plane was from m&s. chose the ploughmans option having looked at the glossy catalogue. the food bore little resemblance to the photograph - dry and not filled. i feel sorry for the cabin crew as it takes them ages to serve the food	 receive payment (you cant use cash) and then clear it all up. passengers near the rear of the aircraft would be lucky to be served. british airways european flights are nothing more than a no-frills airline. so much cost cutting it opens the door to look at other cheaper options offering the same service. this is not good enough.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | i am writing to complain about my deeply distressing british airways flight from london heathrow - cape town with a change at johannesburg. the flight was badly managed throughout. when i arrived at heathrow	 i was told by a member of staff that my name was not on the system. she eventually found it	 she then said oh im sorry to tell you that there are no more seats on the flight. i was obviously distressed by this as imagined i would have to return back to dorset? however	 after much insisting she eventually eventually found my seat. i arrived at the gate in good time for my flight to johannesburg. however we were all waiting for about a further half an hour past the time we were meant to have departed the airport. in this time	 there were no explanations as to why we were so late boarding the plane. once on the plane	 again we waited and waited and waited - and eventually we were told that sorry for the inconvenience	 but ba did not have enough time to the the engineering works	 or refuel or do the mandatory paper work for this plane during the day. so we were extremely late in setting off from heathrow. i think this is a poor excuse for not departing at the correct time and we were not given enough notifications throughout the lengthy wait. i was concerned about catching my next flight from johannesburg to cape town. the flight attendant told me not to worry and there will be lots of ba ground staff to help us all when we arrive at johannesburg. however	 this could not have been further from the truth. once landed there were no british airways staff present - except for one lady in a high vis jacket who explained to people that needed to get the connecting flight to johannesburg to leave their luggage as it would be put on the plane and to run to the next gate for the flight. she then pointed at a man (he was wearing no uniform) saying he will take me and another passenger to gate. we literally ran through the airport and then the man asked for a tip? i gave him  but was extremely suprised that i would have to tip someone who supposedly ba advised me to go withonce getting to the gate and (just in time) the lady at comair said radioed through and told us they had already sold our tickets	 and rudely shouted at me as to why? did you leave your luggage by this point i had tears falling and was feeling extremely overwhelmed. she then told us to just go back with no further help. luckily another passenger was with me and was kind enough to show me the ba check in desk to ask for new tickets to cape town. once at the ba deskthey were not helpful in the slightest. they simply told me to go and get my luggage from a menzies which was the other side of the airport and see if it was there. i ran too and fro the menzies (lost luggage) to the comair and ba office - back and forth for around  hours. no staff were helpful even though i was crying and feeling completely bewildered.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | having flown first class from london to cape town and club back from johannesburg i have really noticed a significant downgrade in ba service and standards compared to premium flights i have taken in previous years. the seats in first had crumbs on them on arrival	 in club there was sticky stuff on the arm rest which hadnt been cleaned. on the return club flight in particular	 the purser told us on the tannoy that staffing levels were low so service would be slower; on  occasions i had to ask for a g&t	 eventually i only received it by going to the galley. it was made clear by the staff that they resented my interrupting their jokes and conversation. food in club was average. first lounge in t not great: sole elemis spa person decided to take an hour off from - (leaving a scribbled paper sign saying back in an hour) which wasnt helpful given several long haul flights were leaving at pm. when i tried to book an appointment on her return	 she told me she was busy and full (whilst checking facebook on her iphone). in terms of hard product	 the club seat just doesnt compare with rivals any more: its way too narrow and storage space is dire. these flights were miles burn	 i wont be accruing more avios with ba.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,las vegas to london with british airways was awful. we were in first class	 travelling with  young children and wanted to put them to bed on this long flight	 and we had booked a row of  seats so we could sleep one child one adult. we check in at first class which was delayed	 as they are busy and have moved some economy passengers to the first class line to speed up things. then we are told one of our seats has been moved	 the staff are unsure as to why and will rectify this immediately and bring my boarding pass to the lounge. an hour later i go to the check in desk as nobody from ba has been bothered to come - i am then told	 actually your seat is broken nothing we can do	 and its now my problem. this seat is in the middle	 therefore it means either one child alone on the otherside of the cabin or the  children together behind me and my husband alone the other side of the cabin. no other options and british airways are not prepared to ask anyone to swap seats so we can sit  together on different rows. we kept the children together behind me	 obviously meaning i could not sleep the whole flight and my husband was alone. then the lamp on my childs seat malfunctioned and was on full beam the whole night flight keeping one of them awake - the attendents were unable to override the light - seriously. they did offer to seat my child at the front of the cabin in a different seat	 alone surrounded by strangers or to move me to the front which would have left my children completely alone. on out outward flight from london to vegas one of our seats also malfunctioned and the tv etc went down for the entire journey - nothing the cabin staff could do then either. apparently they are old planes! we are still waiting for a response from british airways.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,british airways flight from london heathrow to glasgow. shabby cabin	 lacklustre cabin crew	 flight deck crew whose announcements were mainly less than informative. a crew which appeared to be going through the motions with little enthusiasm and as little engagement with passengers as possible. some time after the cabin crew had closed all of them	 the overhead locker above my seat fell open before the plane even moved off stand at lhr. on descent into gla it opened again and hung open for several minutes and i was tempted to unclip and close it. i made the passenger across the aisle aware in case the bags fell out on top of him. eventually	 the cabin crew member whose jump seat faced up that aisle got up and closed it. we should have been sitting upfront given our ticket class (part of a longer trip)	 but	 after service issues with ba and a long journey prior to this flight	 we couldnt be bothered pointing that out. just another shabby experience to add to the other disappointments with regard to service and lounge provided by ba on a long return trip involving two other airlines	 who were streets ahead in all ways.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,i think its hilarious seeing andrews blatant contradictions. calling yourself an advocate for peace but you can understand how a group of people literally charred babies in ovens. says peace is always worth a conversation but hannas turns down every deal offered. says what israel is doing is genocide but not even acknowledging thats what the palestinians want is the eradication of all jews.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | boston to barcelona via london. i am a silver ba card holder and reserved two flights (myself and my wife) from boston to london heathrow (in premium economy) and heathrow to barcelona in economy class. i paid for seat reservations for my wife on both legs as she has a bronze card and cannot reserve without paying. on check in at boston we were given different seats for the heathrow to barcelona sector than i had reserved (in the exit row)	 due to a change of aircraft configuration. although the booking was made months before no advance notice was given of the change. in early june i applied for a refund of the seat reservation cost and was given a case number. to date there has been no communication or refund from ba in spite of my sending a second email asking for information. overall the service onboard and attention to customers has declined significantly over the past year due to cost cutting measures. we will not be flying transatlantic with ba in the future after  years of several crossings each year. in an article about british airways in the financial times on nd june it said that their customers are less and less happy	//,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,after the previous interview	 this one piers showed alot more respect to andrew	 and it seems that piers agree with the most of andrews statements. the only thing that i think that andrew needs to change is the way he expresss in his posts in order to people get his point in a positive way	 and to be honest all the womens that disagree with him is only because they get the message wrong that he is traying to send	 but in their minds they live by the morals that hes trying to send to everyone. it was a very good interview	 i enjoyed watching it. and also as i see it piers is a fan of andrew :d,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,how much was the price of your conscience piers?,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,i disagree with andrew on this subject. heres why: first	 we have to go back to the beginning of all of this. its essentially a religious war. wars	 battles	 genocide	 and such have been happening in this part of the world for a long time. the fact is	 the land belongs to israel. the bible predates the quran by  years and never mentions mohammad or allah. regardless of how you view the bible	 whether as a religious text or not	 it holds significant historical value. the bible states that the land has always belonged	 rightfully so	 to the israelites.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,: wow piers. you love to try and finish people sentences or make a overall assumption after one statement but if i did the same it sounds as if you condemn hamas and think israel is justified. if piers was interviewing himself but in a opposite stance on the issue this is surely what he would conclude. you sat here this entire interview making a case that if you dont condemn hamas then you are a sympathizer to their cause. yet you challenge tate when he says he wouldnt just try to flatten a entire city with bombs as if it were the logical thing to do. as if you couldnt imagine him or anyone for that matter coming up with a more appropriate response. you disgust me.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,holy fudge this comment section has been completely taken over by the andrewtards,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,a mediocre service on this airline flying from london heathrow to stuttgart	 which was to be expected given my prior flights with them. check-in process was fine at heathrow. after security	 i went to the first class lounge on the south side of heathrow terminal . the lounge had no air conditioning and so was very hot as it was a fairly warm day outside - this made it quite uncomfortable. the hot food selection was poor - everything was very liquid based and looked unappetizing. there were a few bland sandwiches available as well. while the lounge itself is in a beautiful	 large room	 it is really let down by the lack of good food and service. boarding process was seamless at the gate. the plane had been recently renovated but the seats were highly uncomfortable. there is very little legroom available and if youre taller than 	 youre knees will likely be touching the seat in front of you. food offering was very limited with only a small bag of chips on offer and one drink. flight attendants were courteous but didnt really go beyond the minimum. no inflight entertainment or wifi whatsoever was available	 which is really a disappointment given that so many other airlines are now installing this. overall	 the trip was fine but the onboard and lounge experiences could be improved.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,london heathrow to vancouver with british airways. it is okay but really for business class you expect more. the lounge at vancouver crowded with no/inedible food. plane ancient and cabin filthy - really falling apart - didnt want to touch the storage lockers. service pretty good	 food good (except breakfast was virtually non existent). entertainment horrific. not one good film to watch and none that seemed recent. small range. bed is comfortable flat. phone customer service at ba not usually a good experience. i fly it because theres not much choice on this route but i will try air canada next time.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,no doubt piers is a hypocrite,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,piers said that asking women to just live for their family is mysogenistic and that there are women who love working	 but as the number of women who work increase	 the women who are unhappy and divorced	 children with no father have increased	 while the women who live as a housewife	 living for their husband are way happy. you can see the stats by looking at past.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,andrew is % correct. most women want to work when theyre young and fresh out of high school or college. after a few years	 a good majority of them would be very happy to meet a man with a high enough income to allow them to stay home or work casual jobs whenever they felt like it. many women work because they have to	 not because they want to. lets be honest	 nobody really wants to work. sure	 work is fulfilling and youre proud to work hard and provide things for your family...but everyone has moments where they wish they could hit the lottery and never have to work another day.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,london gatwick (lgw) to lanzarote (ace). we havent flown ba for sometime and to be honest we have no desire to fly with ba again anytime soon. the plane was an airbus  and was just like a bus. uncomfortable hard very upright seats not even sure you can recline them. we sat in row  and on both outward and inbound flights the cabin temperature was far to hot and stuffy although it seemed to be an issue in just  rows as the front and back of the plane was much cooler. we both came off the return flight with bad headaches. the food was simply awful thank goodness we ate a proper breakfast before boarding as the minuscule roll and wrap was hardly enough to feed a child and on that topic the food was not suitable for a young toddler and there was no child option. the service was ok nothing to complain about very matter of fact and despite the previous comments the plane was clean etc. we flew the same route in october last year with a uk holiday airline and that was all round far more superior.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,flipping the script and making piers defend using the loverboy method to get the interview with him was top g shit!  so entertaining	 laughed my ass off!  i find it interesting that as soon as tate was making great points on on his opinion based upon thousands of years of evidence	 on how women are emotional creatures and dont have the best record of making good decisions for themselves	 so they should be protected under a mans care and listen to him	 how a man should be the head of the house making rules for the family and discipline and direction is how a man loves	 he was quickly dismissed	 interrupted	 shamed as a misogynist.  its repulsive.  most men dont abuse their god given right to have authority over their family as a weapon	 and just because some men (probably raised by a single dominant mother) do.  that is disingenuous.  just because a man can doesnt mean he will	 and just because some (deranged and undisciplined) men do shouldnt give cause to pain all men with the same broad brush.  i am not saying this because tate says it	 im saying it because its truth.  i am saying it because this is the structure of family that i grew up in.  my stay at home mom submitted to my father	 and willingly submitted herself to the authority of my father so she could have the privilege of his protection and financial care.  they always respected each other	 but she always followed his lead regardless of how she felt about it and if she disagreed she surely didnt show it	 or penalize him for it by emasculating him.  to me my mother was the epitome of a strong woman and has earned the respect of her children.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | the many problems i had with my outbound flight paled in comparison to my return. on arrival at t from another carrier i went to the ba baggage check in and was told that unlike every other major carrier in a major hub airport anywhere on the planet	 ba cannot possibly transfer bags to my departure terminal	 t. the agent made it clear it could be done but that she would get in trouble. fast track security was woefully slow and incompetent. when i arrived at the gate boarding had commenced. though i had purchased a business upgrade to avoid some of the horrible service i had received on my outbound flight and despite having only two carry on items and despite managements false statements in their replies to my earlier complaints that our hand baggage allowance at two bags with a kg limit for the is also one of the most generous	 despite the fact that the flight was not full and more than half of the bin space in business class was empty	 i was forced to check my bag carry-on compliant bag. the flight attendants were rather shocked about this and later apologized for the gate agents unwarranted behavior. the flight was okay with the same uncomfortable coach seats in business class and an inedible food offering. in all a waste of money for bas vaulted business class experience. the recent economist article about bas race to the bottom service tier and the reneged promises made along the way speaks volumes about managements hostility towards customers and especially ba and ow elites. the asterisk on the oneworld baggage page singles out ba as the only carrier in the group who will not allow its own elite fliers and those on ow to have a checked bag on the lowest and only competitive fare ba offers. as the economist article stated	 loyalty is very easy to lose but extremely difficult to re-attain.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,hamas was funded and supported by the israeli government.  this is a fact that anyone can look up.  second of all	 there is clear indication that some people within the israeli government and secret service knew about the planned attack on oct th.  which is to say	 the israeli government used hamas as an excuse to expand territory.  apart from geopolitical reasons	 there is a huge financial element in this because there is significant off shore gas reserves that israeli plan on expoiting.  the gaza situation with palestinians complicates and threatens the proposed israeli pipeline into europe.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,the outward trip manchester - heathrow - milan was fine with even a guide to take us to our connection at lhr terminal . the return trip munich - heathrow - manchester was not so good. the system would not let me check-in online and despite being the first in the queue at airport check-in we had already been allocated seats right at the back (we discovered on boarding - no plan or explanation given on check-in) with no recline. both planes were late and at heathrow especially the communication was poor: at one point the board said please wait then there was a last call even though the gate had not yet opened; the staff seemed unconcerned at the delay no explanation or apology were offered unless they were in the inaudible announcement but i doubt it as it was quite short. having arrived at munich to check in at .pm we eventually got to manchester at pm not too late as the pilot made up some of the lost time (all excellent pilots by the way). but during this time the only refreshments were a small packet of crisps and a drink twice. not impressive although the staff on board were friendly and polite.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | shanghai to tampa via heathrow/gatwick. we received deplorable customer service recently from british airways. i purchased business class tickets on // for flights on september 	 . i purchased two tickets for a total of $	. plus an additional $ for seat assignments. the problems occurred on our return flights. we were booked october 	  on ba shanghai to lhr london with continuing service	//	  from london gatwick)to tampa. we were disembarking a cruise ship at the port of shanghai on october 	 . we checked in online  hours before our flights scheduled departure at : a.m. on the evening of october 	  the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as scheduled at : a.m. in the morning on october 	 the captain announced that the chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dock. after these announcements we frantically tried to contact british airways because we expected that we would miss our : am flight. we were unable to do so. we were informed that in order to exit china without a visa	 we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country. we were aware of this requirement. we had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane. we knew that without a visa of valid flights out	 we would be escorted to the local chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country. for obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation. we were able to contact a travel agent via e-mail (our phone was not operating as we were at sea in chin ). our agent was able to contact british airways and explain our situation. there was another flight that departed on october 	 which was  hours  minutes after our original flight. that was flt ba . we were told here are your choices: . pay a change fee of $ and be down graded to premium economy on both flights	 ba  and ba  	 even though we would be able to make ba  as it did not depart london (lgw) until : am on october 	 . . pay an additional $	 per person for a total of $	 to keep our business class status on both flights. (we had already paid $	. for these tickets). . disembark the ship and take our chances with chinese immigration. option  was outrageous	 option  frightening. we felt we had no choice but to choose option . the travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at check-in and request our business class seats if they were available. when we checked in at pvg we asked if there were business class seats available. yes	 several was the response. we explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats. yes	 for a cost of $	 . of course we refused to pay that amount. we were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class	 two suitcases were over the  lbs limit for economy. while on board during that flight ba	 i went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats. when we arrived in london we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats. were we on the same flight as originally scheduled	 but i was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers. apparently british airways sold our seats or an upgrade to other passengers at our expense.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,when morgan said that they didnt force you to get the vaccine is a lie. in nursing homes in the uk	 if you didnt have a vaccination for covid then you were made to leave and could no longer work in them. until they tried to force the nhs into doing the same	 until the staff were about to go on strike and the government backtracked and said they dont have to have it. as soon as the nhs staff won then guess what	 people that lost their jobs in nursing homes for not having the vaccine were allowed to get jobs back in that industry.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,this issue is so complicated that without first discussing many details before arriving at a yes or no answer would be misinformative and that is what piers is doing.  he is more concerned with pushing misinformation than understanding.  andrew	 was not given the option of informing him of those details only to state yes or no and that would have been misleading. it not of mattered if he said yes or no.  since he wasnt given the respect to explain his points piers twisted it into what he wanted the answer to be.  how is that a good interviewer?  how is that unbiased journalism?  how is that professional?  andrew didnt get the opportunity to answer the question only the option of yes or no.  piers didnt care what he answered it was  just to make him look bad.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,i have flown twice with ba now in business class (to and from delhi) and i have to say it has been absolutely poor! me and a few colleagues flew out to new delhi for a business trip. ba were the pioneers of aircrafts after all they did create the concorde. key word in that is were theyve basically turned into a no frills airline. allow me to explain: the blue worn carpets padded fabric seats with stains worn out grey plastic panels with little grains of grit and dirt get into and a tft which had the same image quality as vhs tape! the decor looks like it was directly taken out of the  film airplane! you still get the odd knock on the legs when economy passengers are boarding then plane with hand luggage as there is no private space! staff were fine but flying business class a customer should get a wow factor - and there was none. the plastic translucent slider that divides the seats had been battered from being shifted up and down when the crew serve the food and drinks. the toilets are exactly the same as economy except in business class they stick a plastic flower in a glass. the food was ok but again nothing special. normally its the little things that make the differences but with ba they need a total make over. for a flight that happens everyday from london to delhi ba should be doing more. the decor of the plane matched the experience i got with ba dull. i wont be flying long haul with them again. my advice - avoid ba and before you book your flights have a look online at what other airlines can offer you.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | istanbul to london heathrow with british airways. the main reason i pay to travel business class is to get extra leg room. bas club europe now gives you exactly the same leg room as in economy	 which may be okay for a quick hop to paris	 but is definitely unsatisfactory on this near four hour flight. it was particularly annoying to see children sitting in row  - the only row with reasonable leg room. service was fine and the food quite good	 but no entertainment at all. from now on ill book economy and pay for exit seats - its a no-brainer. either that or fly turkish airlines	 an airline which is going from strength to strength.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,flew jnb-lhr return. only considered ba because they fly the a on the route which is undoubtedly the best aircraft to fly on. only hit minor turbulence in both directions so one can easily get some rest. ba have undoubtedly upped their game in premium economy - the  equivalent was about the worst in the sky. the a is a considerable improvement. only gripe is that on premium economy you get no special boarding benefits so by the time i got on the plane the cabin was already full - can only assume the others all had the relevant frequent flyer privilege. anyway the food was superb with proper crockery and cutlery attentive service and superb entertainment. but i really only recommend flying the a if you are unlucky to find yourself on the old s expect the opposite - a cramped cabin with mediocre seats and regular economy class service.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,we travelled on flight ba from heathrow to singapore on th july  and it is most unlikely we would travel with them again. we were supposed to depart at  and had arrived early to escape the rush and heat of london. when we checked the departures board we noticed no gate number had been allotted to our flight. we hung around gate a area and waited for further advice and waited and waited. the clock ticked on and we all waited for the advice the board is supposed to display. come  (supposed to be boarding) and still no gate number or advice as to the delayed boarding. i could go on and on but finally at  (yes  minutes after scheduled departure time!) the board declared that we had to go to gate b area for a  departure. still no explanation as to why we were an hour late. we caught the transit service and headed over there finally boarding the plane after the rescheduled departure time. the air conditioning was virtually non-functional and we were forced to sit in the stinking heat waiting for some sort of explanation and apology. the staff seemed surly and disinterested in our discomfort and one stewardess near us at the rear of the plane refused two requests from passengers to bring water using the defence that she was on my own back here and cannot leave my post. incredibly she left her post several times when it suited her to talk to other stewards etc! about  the captain announced that they had lost a passenger and we should depart within - minutes. finally at  we took off after sitting in the terrible heat and humidity of all those bodies for over an hour with no service of drinks or anything else after boarding over an hour late! yes we departed  hours and  minutes late and still without explanation or apology of any kind from any of the staff! the air conditioning did not start to reduce the temperature until more than  hours into the flight! when we landed at singapore the captain announced that he hoped the ongoing passengers hadnt been too inconvenienced by the hold-up. i guess that was bas apology? totally disgraceful ba andwe still dont know why we were delayed.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | london heathrow to istanbul. british airways is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for its customers	 even loyal ones who have status like myself. the overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airline. galleries south in t is large	 airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the sunday i travelled. drinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offers - the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredients. onboard it is similarly tired	 the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table. seating is cramped. the cabin crew look dejected and have low morale. onboard experience the service is no different	 than flying easyjet	 in fact i would argue worse. there is no complimentary catering	 you are subjected to m&s sandwiches. it is not cheap and or good value or any better than lcc offerings. service is slow and took the whole of . hours of the flight - meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle - i was even asked to wait until i was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people. the slow service is due to the use of card only payment	 and also the fact the supplier doesnt allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down. on the return journey its clear ba doesnt care about its european or non-north american routes - the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar	 in fact it was dark dingy and furniture filthy	 but least the food was decent. overall if it wasnt for the fact i flew with ff miles and the low tax on redemptions within europe	 i would never actually pay the full cash fare for this airline - you get better more efficient service on the likes of easyjet now within europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,not verified | cairo is a  hour flight and ba considers it to be short haul	 so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. not even a magazine - which is now available by wifi that you have to pay for. you have to pay for your seat choice	 checked in baggage	 food & drink	 wifi. not that i have anything against that - im used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. i would have preferred to fly on easyjet where the initial ticket would have been less	 and the extras would have been half the price. the ba app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. and dont get me started on their customer service helpline. on board the staff are ok but on the long cairo-london route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. and for the flyers who dont want the hassle of charges	 minimal cabin service	 and budget seats	 then they could easily provide a premium economy option and really make a difference for the experience. heathrow terminal  compounds the poor experience	 especially for arrivals. it is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near gatwick which is being abandoned by ba. i have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a ba gold card holder at one point - so i know about the potential experience. i used be able to make the choice - do i fly budget	 or do i fly more comfortably for more? now its a case of flying budget	 or flying budget for double the price with ba.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,and this young tate oke 	 needs to remind women of their age   ???,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,i think what mr tate is offering his partner is a very nice and generous thing.  obviously if the relationship is consenting and not abusive its actually an extremely good deal for the women.  i think a very high percentage of good women would agree and would love to live that lifestyle.  how could anyone deny that? taking good care of her health	 having regular beauty appointments	 dressing outstandingly	 shopping	 looking her best	 being a good and happy partner as a job.  on its face that doesnt even come remotely close to making a relationship abusive.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,piers obviously needs to stay on script which only further exposes him as a puppet. but hearing him go on about the success of the covid vaccines and even supporting lockdowns	 may just be another dumbed down media hack  assuming he knows more than the average person,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,so if they convince themselves theyre in charge and what they believe is right	 theyll then think their partner should follow and those men might not like that their partner doesnt agree. hes probably creating controlling twats. but really hes trying to create controlling heros which isnt a bad thing	 given they have correct morals,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | the flights were all on time	 except belfast from london which never is. the staff were efficient. my issue is the app	 i could not book seats to tel aviv though tried for a month as wanted to pay. so ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat was available on the flight. the seat was in front of the dividing barrier and was used as thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so i wasted my money on pe seat! you can get hold of ba customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just wont use them again.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,piers morgan was promoting these so called poison shots and calling all us conspiracy theorists morons 	when the evidence came out that everything the conspiracy theorists had said was true	 he back tracked completely and we are still waiting for an apology.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,now	 some women like this life and others feel uneasy by it. fact is	 as there are different types of men	 there is different type of women. base line is that the intention behind tates idea of the role of men towards women is not bad	 its to be the provider and having the women play the receiver part and being grateful for the life she lives. its just a way of living that some want tate is not responsible for how people perceive his words. parents have to do their job as well and educate the teens about what is the message he is  giving.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | the decline of british airways. my review is primarily on ba euro traveller in economy. up to two years ago one felt good when travelling ba. they were miles ahead of budget airlines. yes they were a bit more expensive	 but one enjoyed reasonable food and beverage	 checked in cases of kg	 all part of the service. today ba provides no free food or beverage	 and require extra payment for check in luggage. today	 within europe	 ba has absolutely no advantage opposite easyjet	 norwegian	 monarch or even ryanair. why should anyone pay extra for ba	 they have lost absolutely their unique selling points. incidentally coming back from malta to london gatwick in ba in business class	 there is nowhere to hang coats. previously ba flight attendants always hung them in a cupboard. and now no cupboards! extra seats instead. the decline and fall of a once proud ba. in future ba will need to to meet or be cheaper than the budget airlines.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,not verified | i booked flights to rome from the us and then home through london to lax in february of this year for the st of august. i booked through american airlines	 and then i paid for seat selection for  people through the ba website	 paying us $ in total. with the pandemic	 it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to italy and england on this trip as () we are not allowed to travel outside the us	 () as americans we are not allowed to travel to italy or england	 and () the us government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early february. i had to cancel all of our hotels	 airb&bs	 car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds and/or vouchers. ive tried to reach british airways customer service a number of times	 finally got through today after an hour on hold. i asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that i had paid for and was told that i will lose the money i paid	 that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed	 because i booked the trip through american airlines and not through british airways. my understanding is that ba and aa have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners	 though i was shocked at having to pay nearly $ just to reserve our seats in business class	 but this is apparently not the case. i was told that if ba cancels the two flights that we are booked on that i might be able to get either a voucher or a refund. i was prepared today to accept a voucher that i could use when i rebook this trip for 	 as i understand that ba (and all airlines) are suffering financially as much as i am	 but i was not prepared to be totally ripped off by ba. i cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly	 august st	 to cancel this as i will lose the money and miles i paid american airlines for this flight. i am at a loss as to what i can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my control and for which an airline partner that i valued traveling on is refusing to offer a voucher or a refund. i will never again do anything that gives revenue to british airways.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | london to madrid in economy class. late booking and quite an expensive ticket to fly from heathrow. online check in and no luggage to check in so airport process was okay. boarding quite efficient. cabin was dirty - carpets	 table and windows all unpleasant and cannot believe a cleaner set foot from the earlier flight. everything pay onboard if you want to eat or drink	 choice okay in brochure but the speed for serving this was awful. staff seemed to have real problems with all card payments	 and became bad tempered towards those of us wanting to buy. i wouldnt have minded on a cheap ticket	 but this was not a true case of rip-off ba in . will avoid if possible.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,if it wasnt for my dad being incharge i wouldnt be the man i am today	 he made sure we were set straight when we needed to be. my mum was and still is a heavy drinker	 she cannot cope with her mental health problems which effected her ability to raise us like my dad could/ a normal parent should. if it wasnt for my sense taught from my dad i would have struggled more in my childhood with all the difficulties growing up in the environment i was raised in once they separated. this is no disrespect to my mum in anyway but its no secret that women struggle more with their emotions making their thought process blurry	 we need to stop acting like this is a crime to say as its science and facts! so men being in charge of the house shouldnt be seen as such a bad thing.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,i hate working to my core	 everyday i wake and sleep crying that i dont wanna work  i only work to have financial safety and afford feeding a hundred stray cat in our area	 also and take care of my own  rescue cats.. if i found support taking care of my rescue cats id have been able to take a breather	 so correct	 we women mostly would love the ability to stay home	 take care of our partner and kids and just live happy  but everything is so expensive and life is so hard,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,yvr-lhr-ams. an uneventful journey with ba but their boeing  from vancouver was a flashback to the s. dated interior with cold colours old seats that recline practically into your face making the already cramped space even more uncomfortable - you could also occasionally feel the persons knees pushing into the back of your own seat. the in-flight entertainment was equally old with a blurry screen and limited choice of entertainment. the cabin crew were courteous and friendly. arrival and transfer in bas terminal  was very smooth and relaxing. the connecting flight to amsterdam was a modern airbus a with bright and comfortable interior/seating. unless ba revamp their ageing  fleet consider fly with virgin air canada or even air transat for the vancouver-london route.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,manchester to new york jfk via heathrow was enjoyable from start to finish. admittedly the boeing  was showing its age and would benefit from some tlc! however the connections were on time	 cabin crew were friendly	 helpful and efficient. my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed the food on offer. prior to the trip i was concerned about using ba again after  or more years of happily using other airlines. i was very happy with everything. if im picky about anything it would be that the strange yin-yang seats in club world were narrow at the shoulder for me	 but once in the lie flat position i found the seat very comfortable. avod was a bit slow and clunky but did work	 screen a bit smaller and duller than comparable screens ive used with air france,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,not verified | we were flying world traveller plus their premium service. what it was not was premium. we have travelled with many airlines and lucky enough to fly premium most times. bas premium is the worst i have come across. the flight from heathrow to jfk was just ok	 the flight back was in a plane that should not be used. old	 dirty	 uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had	 one would not recline and one reclined without using the button. ba needs to look at the premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut costs. they have fallen far behind their competitors	 they were once my preferred airline but now i try and avoid at all costs. i would rather pay more and fly with someone else.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | amman to london. appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service. we are strict vegans so pre-booked vegan meals for our flight. meals were delivered as usual	 and had the vegan slip on them	 but as i was about to start eating i noticed that i had been given butter - this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal. when i called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was	 informing me that there was no meat in it. i had to explain to her what a vegan was (i.e; no dairy or eggs). it turns out that the so called vegan meal had milk and egg in it. needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals. shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley	 so we asked for a coffee with soya milk - the staff to whom i had had to explain what a vegan was said oh i dont think we have that	 but we have semi skimmed milk. i had to re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. when she returned she said we dont provide that sort of thing. that was strange	 because  weeks ago on the outbound journey you did. so we had no meals	 no hot drinks	 and our video screen did not work. the customer service that followed from was more appalling	 they could not care less	 it took ages to get replies and when i did i was just palmed off. after several months of having to write emails i was informed that i had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper	 which was just another way of getting rid of us. so we did this	 after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation - basically the value of the meals that we could not eat - in vouchers.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,not verified | what has happened to british airways? the whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric	 they appear to have gone back to the s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. on the premise its due to covid precautions! they are the only airline making passengers do this and they cant even open all the desks so for  passengers they had two check in staff	 like the post office in ! apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where theyre just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. ive chosen and insisted upon ba for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles	 i also have not one but two ba amex companion vouchers that cost me k of spending to earn so that tells you how much ive supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. in the last year ive booked  ba flights	  personal and  business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries	  of the  have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines	 the personal one to st lucia they cancelled my return  days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for  weeks. that cost me my  holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! a couple of weeks ago i noticed that one of my amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on nov th this year so i tried to speak to them. as the world has largely been closed since march  i assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open	 not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday	 but after  days going around in circles speaking really bad english to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country i finally got through to someone at ba who told me that no they wont extend the voucher! im even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect i will not spend another penny with this airline	 im not even going to bother using my second voucher and ive cancelled my ba amex. i work in the music business managing tours for bands so i reckon i book  flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! roll on the inevitable ba administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the worlds favourite airline but now the most ridiculed. whod have thought ba could ever make ryanair look like an attractive option.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,we flew for the very first time on ba on // and returned //. our holiday to st lucia from gatwick was booked through kuoni and we usually fly with virgin atlantic. we always upgrade with virgin to premium economy as you have a larger luggage allowance and the premium economy experience with virgin is very good. therefore we booked ba world traveller plus expecting the same degree of service. what a disappointment! i would not advise wasting your upgrade money. apart from getting the larger luggage allowance ba world traveller plus is almost exactly the same as world traveller. the service both ways was appalling! the seats were old and shabby and uncomfortable we were only offered bar service once on a / hour flight! we had to drink from plastic beakers the staff seemed preoccupied with business class customers and had no time for our section at all. on the way back my husband and myself were given seats  rows apart at check in without being told. we only noticed when we boarded the aircraft. on this length of flight i was most upset we were apart as everyone sat near me were single travellers and were asleep throughout the  hours. the seat back tvs are very small and my tv didnt work properly and i couldnt even watch anything. the aircraft was badly in need of an interior upgrade. we will never fly with ba again anywhere and will not recommend the experience to anyone.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,andrew tate	 by your own logic	 who do you think is more powerful	 a man who is biologically designed to suppress his emotions and compelled to make rational and logical decisions or a woman who	 although biologically designed to be more emotional than a man	 makes the painful effort to suppress her instincts and learn how to make stoic and competent decisions? women dont exist in this world for the sole purpose of pleasing a man	 no more than populations from africa existed to be enslaved by the white men of the th century america. we want to discover and explore our intelectual potential	 which is this wonderful combination between the power of reason and the wisdom of empathy	 in order to bring meaning to our own lives	 but also the lives of the people around us. women are great doctors	 lawyers	 architects	 artists and the world would be a poorer one without women exercising their ability to find a vocation and thrive in it. its not about working versus non working cause you can afford to live off your partners fortune	 its about being equals in a relationship	 because a woman who has never worked a day in her life may be able to always put on a groomed smile for you	 but she will never understand your hurdles and the challenges that you face every day and thus will never be able to offer you deep emotional connection and love. the world that you picture in your ideas is an imbalanced one	 a backwards way	 as piers so correctly puts it	 however we need to evolve as a species and you as a man need to start seeing that women may not only be your equals in the professional landscape	 but a woman who trains her mind and spirit as hard as an achieving man	 will most likely end up becoming better at the same job	 thats just how the creator made us	 as weve surely proven on many occasions throughout the history of mankind.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,we travelled economy from manchester to toronto via heathrow the flight from manchester to heathrow and return was very good. the seats had plenty of room and it was easy to fit laptop size briefcases under the seat in front and still have room to stretch your legs. the service from the cabin crew was excellent. the leg from heathrow to toronto was not as comfortable but it was acceptable. the seats appeared narrower and my case only just fit under the seat leaving little room to stretch my legs. whilst the cabin crew forgot requests for drinks they apologised and were very friendly and helpful in other aspects. unfortunately ba were let down by the attendants on the return leg from toronto to heathrow. whilst the aircraft appeared newer and more comfortable i have never experienced such surly behaviour from the cabin crew. we had seen attendants in the opposite aisle offering passengers water from trays they were carrying but the attendants down our aisle did not do this. the lady in the seat next to me asked for a glass of water before take off. the steward was quite off hand and said he would bring her one in a minute. he did not do this and when she asked again she was told in a very rude manner that take off procedures took priority otherwise non of us were going anywhere. even after take off she had to ask again. when they served dinner my daughter did not want a meal but she asked if she could just have the bottle of water that was served with it. the steward said that if she did not want the meal she could not have the water but that he would bring her some in a glass later. this had not appeared by the time i had finished eating my meal so i gave her the bottle from mine (my daughter has a medical condition that requires her to drink water frequently throughout the day) shortly before landing we were served a muffin and a drink. the passengers on the other aisle were served about  mins earlier and they were handed paper napkins and cutlery whilst when we were served we were simply handed the muffin wrapped in cellophane but no plate or napkin to catch the crumbs. i asked for a glass of orange and a tea (as i had not drunk anything on the  hour flight). the attendant scowled at me and then gave me half a glass of orange and half a cup of tea (which was cold|) i did not see the attendants down our aisle smile at a customer once throughout the whole journey.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,lisbon to london on nd november was like many other flights affected by the thick fog which forced cancellation and delays of so many flights into heathrow. the plane was boarded at normal departure time	 just in case this flight got a slot into heathrow	 and kept informed of developments by the flight deck. since at one point it appeared likely our slot might not open up till . (scheduled at .) the food and drink service was started	 and cabin crew did a great job keeping a congenial atmosphere in the cabin whilst doing this. eventually we did get a slot at . and got into heathrow round .. it was quite stressful for those passengers who had connections to make (i did make my connection that afternoon to washington)	//,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | my family and i travelled from cape town to london on the th march . we have a  year old and a  year old. once seated	 we realised that our entertainment system was not working. the cabin light for all seats that we had booked were not working either. there was minimal effort from the cabin team to try and resolve this. as it was a night flight	 my wife and i had to see to our  year old in the dark. any help we needed required us to walk to the galley to receive any assistance. as bas safety demonstration prior to take off is on video	 we didnt receive this. the flight was the worst airline experience weve had. i doubt ill ever fly with ba again.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,unverified | london heathrow - pisa return. i fly this route often as i have a house in tuscany. i fly british airways club europe only because the fas are better	 the lounge is a welcome benefit - and if you book far ahead enough - you can get a reasonable deal plus avious points. that aside there is little benefits to flying say ryanair. the trip started at t and the northern lounge was not	 for a change	 to busy. had a fruit and coffee breakfast. the options were a group of highly unhealthy looking bacon baps - dripping fat all over the place. some years ago - ba provided some nice scrambled eggs. now they dont. flight left from the a terminal and we boarded downstairs from the lounge. the plane was half full. it was clean and valeted. we pushed back  minutes early. my wife had a sort of brunch thing	 cheese and ham + rolls. she said it was ok. i had a couple of gin and tonics. the fa said she had never seen such an empty flight - and neither had i for that matter. the now chargeable food and beverages in economy went down like a lead balloon apparently. i read the ba brochure on the now chargeable food and as a sales and marketing professional - it was the most patronising piece of rubbish id ever read. it read as if ba were providing the most amazing product to the benefit of all. and goodness me - the products are not cheap - over a  for a kit kat. we landed ahead of time and has to walk the tarmac like ryanair customers. several years ago you had the air-bridge. now you dont. the return flight started in the shared lounge which was rammed. this in part is due to qatar airlines operating out of pisa and their business class customers use the same facility. some booze and snacks - nothing edible. flight delayed by  minutes. plane was rammed. very pleasant fas. afternoon tea - with horrible dried out sandwiches + scones that didnt look like scones. on both flights - the usual three seats with the centre seat being a table. no legroom. hopelessly inadequate product which can be as high as  return. docked at the b terminal and had to walk miles to the trains - that took us back to t/terminal a. all in all - another disappointing experience from the worlds most frugal airline.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,piers is the absolute worst interviewer when it comes to this matter. his bias is clear & once you try to make a point he doesnt want you	 to or try to speak the truth	 he speaks over you when you are trying to reply. it is actually his feaer of the truth that makes him try to shut up people so much	 terrible one sided journalism	 very very sad,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,british airways from tampa to gatwick on boeing  club world. having travelled out wt plus to miami we got a good deal coming back from tampa so flew club class. checked in at tampa with no queues	 and used the international lounge at tampa. supposed to be exclusive to ba customers this had comfortable seats	 and good choice of newspapers and magazines. did not try wifi. however	 there was disappointingly very poor choice of snacks - a few dried up sorry looking sandwiches which were not replenished during my time there	 and crackers with some processed cheese with a few dips	 some wine	 beer	 liquor and soft drinks. pretty uninspiring stuff. on board comfortable	 if narrow	 seats that extended into (more or less) flat beds. british airways still have the very camped -- layout with fellow passengers having to clamber over people to go to the rest room etc. reasonable meal (beef) accompanied by an outstanding chablis premier cru and a very nice sauvignon blanc. my wife slept for  straight hours - i could only sleep fitfully as not much room at shoulder level but at least the seats were comfortable. terrible selection of films on the entertainment system. took off on time	 and landed slightly early. fas quite smiley and nice.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | funchal to gatwick. due to adverse weather	 our return flight was delayed three days. when we did fly	 the cabin crew appeared totally unaware of the fact that the passengers had had a difficult and frustrating time. they were totally unsympathetic and provided a chaotic service throughout the flight. the catering service was absymal	 no choice of hot meal; hardly a bar service and no tea/coffee - i suspect although the aircraft arrived empty from lgw	 they hadnt fully loaded the food & drinks trolleys. in contrast to the outgoing flight	 this was a flight to be endured - just shows what a difference the crew can make.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | bahrain to boston via london. first time flying ba after flying qatar	 emirates and oman air business class. check in at bah was quick and efficient with their seperate business and first class check in area. ba uses the dilmun lounge	 which is basic but adequate. the flight from bah to lhr was on a . the seats are in a xx configuration and are very narrow (similar to premium economy seats	 and marginally larger than the economy seats) though reasonably comfortable. when fully flat there is not much room	 and people over  feet will struggle. there was hardly any storage space	 and the ife screen was very small and of poor quality. the food was very average (i had the carrot and pumpkin soup). cabin crew was disengaged and the plane felt old and tired. the lounge in heathrow is large	 but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortably. the bathrooms in both the main ba lounges are quite dated and need a good clean far more often then they get. the quality of food in the lounge is average	 though the wine and spirit selection is decent. the flight from lhr to bos was on a  and this was similar to the  - old and tired with cramped seating for business class. cabin crew were a bit better on this leg	 though still disengaged. the food was of average quality	 though the wine list	 while small	 was good. overall	 ba has the feel of a budget carrier compared to some of its middle eastern counterparts. the lounge is sub par	 particularly when compared to the qatar lounge in doha	 or even the qantas / one world lounge in lax. the business class ticket was reasonably cheap	 though i can now see why. given the choice i would not fly ba again.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,so instead of attacking what he said they choose to attack his character. they talk of who is broke and funded by who	 while never taking the time to actually digest his actual words. so many of the commenters here are the absolute embodiment of a dunce bat. there were events that lead up to october th	 anyone who doesnt understand that really shouldnt be commenting as they are uneducated about the situation and thus not qualifies to provide an educated response. what happened on october the th cannot be defended	 but even then	 you still can understand why it happened. same thing with israels response. the basic rules of engagement in war dictates that you dont do what israel did. you cant just casually bomb an hospital just because some bad guys are near there	 thats is like saying russia should have launched nukes at ukraine and leveled it because they wanted to join nato	 absolute nonsense. people need to stop dying	 thats what needs to happen. discuss peace. lets start today.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | premium economy dont waste your money on an overnight flight! going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace! the food (i use this term lightly) wasnt fit for dogs on our flight	 it was salmon we think as it didnt taste of anything	 a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it. the veg tasted burnt	 bread roll was ok. (not really a saving grace). one cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and dont bother asking what was in the box left on our table! i didnt bother trying it. the look on other peoples faces was good enough for me to know dont bother! which in comparison to the outbound flight (london to orlando) was worlds apart	 greeted with a drink which was the first of many	 dinner was nice	 the steak edible	 veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks! inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be wifi but couldnt log on so saved some money there. i really thought this was going to be the best way to travel. oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing	 homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane. but that really shouldnt happen. what is not told when booking	 homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have tsa pre you dont have to join the massive queue	 look for pre entered tsa line thats the one thats empty cause they tell no one about it.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,this man is a just a modern day pimp	 possibly the most successful of them. he has just taken the pimping game to social media 	 just like hugh hefner took the game to the magazines etc. however	 his problem is he is a black guy pimping out lil white girls	 and like the black pimp on the street corner	 the law will always and has come for him. however	 like most pimps he is smart and knows the way to defend himself is to garner support from the racists	 bigots and conspiracy theorists. tate knows morgan is a bigot thats why he threw him a little red meat with the shade on blm	 just to keep him on side and morgan lapped it up and you notice morgan become agreeable and shows his liking of him for that reason. cos he appeals to his bigotry. people like morgan and the types that support the rioters will support anyone regardless of what they do	 including those that pimp out their daughters	 as long as they hate the blacks. thats why candace owens does what she does and is so successful	 its also not surprising that they get on very well. they are both involved in the same game of making money out of bigoted white folk. also	 his narcism is such that he thinks he can talk his way out of this mess. with everything he says you can hear him preparing and practicing his defence. we will see just how smart the romanian system is.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,thoroughly disappointed with this supposed legacy airline. having been delayed for an hour on my british airways connecting flight to lhr and stuck overnight at a heathrow hotel i was looking forward to getting going on the morning flight. reality check. this aircraft is old and decrepit and was built in the s	 it should have been retired long ago. a quick google search shows that this aircraft makes up the majority of bas longhaul fleet. the seats are so small and narrow that you are constantly playing elbow hockey with the people on either side of you. i am ft  and weigh kg so how a larger person might survive is beyond me. everything is old and looks it too. even the staff. the seats are worn to the point that you can feel every piece of the metal frame beneath. in fact the lady seated in front of me complained to the cabin crew because she could feel the miniature tropicana bottle i had put the seat pocket. even the safety animation video looks like it was made as a school it project by  year olds. staff are cold and unfriendly	 it would seem that their contracts forbid smiling of any kind. the inflight entertainment screens are smaller than a regular smartphone and have large visible pixels	 it is a struggle to actually see what is being displayed. they are running on brand image only and even then theres only fumes left in tank. do not fly ba at least until they seriously upgrade their fleet.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,returning from chicago to berlin	 the overall flight experience was no better than the outward sectors a week earlier. i opted to skip dinner and instead have breakfast since the flight landed around :. breakfast was a hard slab of cake with one drink - a total disgrace! once again the cabin was too warm and i saw no passengers using their blankets. the berlin flight ex-lhr was delayed	 initially due to the usual late incoming aircraft excuse	 and then to a broken apu. so no air was being pumped in to the cabin and the engines could not be started! for some reason it then took half an hour to locate one that did actually work. meanwhile on one of the hottest days of the year we waited on board in increasingly sauna-like conditions. the captain kept us informed and then made up a bit if time	 although we still landed  minutes late.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,london gatwick to valencia with british airways. boarding the flight at gatwick was good	 professional and orderly. ground staff at the airport were lovely and check in was efficent. onboard we got out of the gate and under way quickly. seats were fine	 plenty of leg room back in economy	 although they seemed to be a little dirty when i sat down but i thought nothing more of it. during the flight the cabin crew were professional doing their duties. all friendly and welcoming. food wise we only got complementary biscuits - a little bit of a let down - but on a short flight like this totally understandable. drinks were fine	 got the normal selection: coke	 coffee	 juices etc. on the return flight it was slightly different. they seemed to have less in stock not only in the food department but also the inflight shop. disappointed in this as what i wanted to buy wasnt avaliable.but on this return flight the positives outweigh the negatives. flight crew again amazing. all kind and welcoming like the first flight. overall the flights were nice. well worth the money. definitely would fly with them again on short haul flights through europe.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,i flew to toronto from manchester via t heathrow on dec  returning on jan . i have no complaints about the inflight experience which was generally very good although i am not sure that premium economy is really worth the money. what i found completely annoying was the lack of air-bridges both on departure and arrival at t heathrow. we were herded on to buses like cattle closely resembling the tube at rush hour and then had to climb steep steps into the aircraft no easy feat with heavy hand luggage and duty free. are there not enough gates with air bridges at t? why is this necessary. i will be flying to toronto again in september but i am not sure it will be with ba if this situation persists.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | london to seattle. my seat was on the upper deck	 a nice perk for seattle flights to europe (ba is the only one flying s to europe from seattle). overall the product is outdated. service was not at the level it used to be. staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum. upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum. no additional service	 no top ups	 not offering water during the flight. of course if you ask for something you do get it. there was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck. i hope ba will improve their act. i certainly wont use their services in foreseeable future.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,every single life is precious (no matter the race	 religion etc)... and the hamas should be condemned... but context matters and it is so annoying when you know a little bit more about history than what the propaganda machine (media	 school etc.) teaches you! the narrative of the sooo good west and the other barbaric nations worldwide or when people like churchill are now represented as kinda holy people... believe me	 that guy was anything but a morally good person. dont believe? do your own research and look up what kinda racist and nasty remarks he made about other ethnicities (indian etc.) or the fact that his egocentric foreign policy has also destroyed the middle east for decades to come (just to get iranian oil as cheap as possible for example). funny that they (us and england) were so motivated to free the jews	 but when it came to their own colonies (f.e. india) or minorities (african americans in the us) they were not that much...oh	 the irony of it! the glorification of the western allies and especially people like churchill as the saviors of the jews is pathetic...their aim never was freeing the jews in the first place	 they even refused to take jewish refugees	 in the beginning of nazi regime they all couldnt give less f*s about the destiny of the german jews. only because they (england) feared losing hegemonial power	 they started the war and now they sell it as if they cared sooo much about humanity and the destiny of the jews (same with the us... not even mentioning french collaborators who in some cases where even worse than their nazi german role models ) ...,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,funny how piers always comes up with the argument how churchill reacted against n*zi-germany	 as it is a good comparison. i didnt know that the n*zis had been robbed of their land piece by piece for  years and put in the largest open-air prison in the world. i also didnt know that the h*mas have imperial motives to rule the world	 like the n*zis did.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,andrew has changed. i think the matrix has got him too. but the way he communicates	 explains his views and discusses is not the same as last year anymore. from an objective point of view piers morgan performed better here even if i generally agree more with andrews view.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,it has come to my mind that pierce is one of those guys can go head to head whith those tough guys after imbarassed my kanye west and also tate himself in first interview but i can tell you know his fit to take any one with experience he got from previous interview,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,so what do you do? get the interview questions in advance	 and spend the same amount of time pondering a response as the interviewer had coming up with the question. why do you think big companies dont take interviews? they issue press releases to control the narrative. thats politics. youre playing checkers while the msm is playing chess.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,my family and i flew from rotterdam to london on th of june	 and its our first time traveling with ba. we chose it as we thought this airlines would be better than budget airlines with constant delays. we were very wrong. we arrived at the airport on time and sat down to wait. ba announced flight delays due to technical error for . hours before finally announcing that the flight was cancelled. we were given no explanation except for one phrase technical fault. we were then unceremoniously sent back to queue in line to be rescheduled. we waited another  mins and was then transferred to a .pm flight (original was .pm). we were denied all chances to board an earlier one at pm. we did not complain or gave ba any trouble. we followed procedures and applied for compensation online. their reply was simply a sorry and they denied all responsibilities.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,london gatwick to orlando. no surprises to guess that as our original flight to tampa was cancelled this is not a good review. due to a technical problem with our plane our flight was cancelled. after finding out from other passengers in the terminal that our flight was cancelled we were marched back through the airport to queue for our luggage to queue to go back through immigration to queue for our details to be entered onto the ba system for an unexplained reason. what an insult to have to stand in line  times for over  hours. no extra staff no positive explanations no apologies no customer service only a lie of a promise of a special flight the following day to our original destination (which did not happen) and some inadequate vouchers for food and drinks. after accepting that our flight was cancelled and then accepting the fact we would be travelling the following day ba then just drop an email to all passengers to advise them what arrangements had really been made. our first arrangement was a flight  hours after our original departure time from heathrow to charlotte to tampa. we did not book our direct flight by accident why on earth we would we accept a flight with a stop over. i declined this arrangement for a flight instead to orlando. a longer busier flight a bigger busier more time consuming airport a  hour drive from our holiday destination. we arrived  hours later than our original arrival time and therefore lost a day and a half of our holiday. to add further insult on our return flight the extra leg room seats we paid  for not allocated to us! uncomfortable claustrophobic seating cheap microwave style food cheap wine unacceptable and a waste of money.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,this was my first time with british airways. i was disappointed in the amount of seat/leg room compared to some other airlines ive traveled with. i was also surprised that on longer european flights london to istanbul for example which i traveled) there was no tv when the flight is as long or longer than flights in asia from country-to-country which have tv/entertainment system. the universal entertainment system was broken too and the sound wasnt working. the service button to call an attendant was broken too. a stewardess on this particular flight from jfk to lhr (ba on june 	 ) was so rude to my daughter. my daughter is unable to eat dairy and both food options on the plane included dairy. my daughter asked nicely if there was any non-dairy options and the stewardess	 takes the food from my daughters tray and says i guess youre just going to have to eat that salad. it wasnt what she said that bothered me	 it was the way she said it. she didnt offer pretzels or non-dairy snacks or anything. this was my first experience with british airways	 and i was disappointed. it wasnt until my flight back home that i felt a bit better. on my ride back with british airways	 not this flight in specific (from lhr to las)	 i encountered a steward who was very pleasant	 polite and very professional.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | london to sofia. cabin crew were kind. this is the only positive thing. british airways are now becoming as bad as ryanair! onboard passengers have to pay ridiculous amount of money even for a small bottle of water. when i booked my flight from heathrow to sofia	 i was told i get a free checked in bag for my baby girl. a day before my flight i decided to double check this and called their customer service line and the guy on the phone told me i need to pay for checked in bag if i want one. i told him that there should be one included for my baby daughter but he said this is not true. i asked him to double check this and he said he already did so i had to pay for a checked bag ( each way) since i already had my suitcase packed. next day	 as i went to the check in at heathrow	 i was asked how many bags do i want to check in. i asked how many bags am i allowed to check in and the lady said i can check in two bags- one for my baby and the one that ive paid for the previous day. the thing is that i only had one suitcase since the guy on the phone told me i can only check one bag (if i pay for it first). after i arrived in sofia	 i rang british airways and explained everything	 so they agreed they should refund the money theyve charged me for the additional bag. they said theyll refund the  for the london-sofia flight the same day and the other  fee for the sofia-london route in about a week time. a month later i checked my online banking and saw theyve only refunded  for the outbound journey. i rang them and theyve said they are sorry and theyll refund the remaining  within the next  days. when i pointed that it should be fair and reasonable that i get a % discount voucher from my next flight price	 they said this is something british airways do not offer.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | the connecting flight to johannesburg was on an older - with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. everything went smoothly and service was good. boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly	 we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. much has been said about the ba ying-yang seat configuration. the seats are narrow	 and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat	 with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. however the seat is very comfortable in any position	 and the white company bedding is excellent. we had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin	 which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. the centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings	 and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. the service on this flight was superb	 from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient	 quick to respond	 and super friendly. preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated	 with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. there was a choice of  starters	  mains	 and  sweets or cheeseboard	 with a decent choice of wines. breakfast offered a good choice	 although we were happy with just the fruit	 yoghurt	 and bread. there could be no complaints in respect of catering. the a is a super aircraft and very quiet	 but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. our connecting flight to leeds was good	 but compared with our south african flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. it is a short flight	 but there was still a full meal service. the only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in leeds. the airport seems quite run-down	 escalator not working	 and few staff to be seen. there was only one other arrival	 but we still waited over  minutes for luggage to come through.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | this was my first time flying with british airways from los angeles to london heathrow. i was able to secure a window seat for myself (without paying any fee) during online check-in  hours prior to departure. the baggage drop-off experience at lax and lhr was smooth. at lax	 the ba staff tags your check-in bags	 at lhr	 you have to do it yourself. the on-board experience was good. this was my first time sitting on the upper-deck of a (which had a special storage bin by the window armrest). food options were consistent with what you find on most transatlantic flights (chicken or pasta). there was no wifi	 but ba had a good collection of movies. i enjoyed bas in-flight movie snack as well. the flight map / tracker wasnt working on one segment	 which was a bit surprising. overall	 i had a pleasant experience and would consider flying with ba again.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | gatwick to antigua. a frequent flyer with ba for over  years	 silver exec club	 i have seen the steadily decline of this airline particularly over the past  months / alex cruz take over. my partner and i fly regularly in eco/prem and club depending on prices	 so have seen the decline across all classes. recent trip to antigua from lgw was awful. a pretty empty cabin	 filthy isnt the word	 awful in flight entertainment (rockwell) that hasnt changed in  years easily. food choice is no longer a choice	 its a meat dish or veg. alcoholic beverages are loaded at origin (lgw) for both legs	 so they have now halved what they usually stocked previously.  hours into flight there was no spirits left - bearing in mind only one drink had been served prior to the meal service . hours in to the flight. ba state in their motto to fly	 to serve. yes they certainly are flying	 but most certainly not serving. the cabin crew are ashamed and embarrassed at the cuts which is evident in their conversations at the back of the aircraft	 and to anyone who speaks to them they are disgusted with what the bosses have done. they have cheapened the brand of the national carrier	 but havent cheapened their prices. easyjet and ryanair offer superior	 and on long haul its got to the point i will now fly virgin and others	 again offer more for your money in all aspects of the flight. stop trying to make ba budget	 we want it back to how it used to be! all i can say is the compensation passengers will be receiving following the major it glitch a fortnight ago is one way of paying customers back for the awful attitude and decline in british airways.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | kuala lumpur to madrid via london. my first time flying ba and i had very low expectations. fortunately	 my experience was pleasant as the seats were generally comfortable and overall service was good. the service (kul-lhr) was brusque. meal was served not long after take off and my child was already sleeping as it was past midnight. i had asked if we could have it later but the reply was a curt no and that they couldnt give it to us later nor would they have any snacks to offer. so if we got hungry we would just have to wait more than  hours later for the next meal. luckily on the return route we had a very courteous cabin crew who spoke politely. both aircrafts appeared new and the seats were wide enough for us. some people complained about the entertainment unit under the seats. what i didnt like though is that the arm rest couldnt be kept up totally between the  seats so that my child could lie across his seat and mine. the armrest kind of went up to a max of  degree angle. the seat pockets were very small so theres very little that can kept inside. the toilets were generally clean but the toilet seat lids didnt work properly. they always fall back down and there was never seat liners. food was below average.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | bangkok to lisbon via heathrow. we booked our flight tickets directly on ba site since july  for the travelling date of december 	 . one day before our travel	 we processed the online check-in and were surprised to find out that our names have been removed from our first leg of the flight (bkk > lhr) without prior notice through any communication channels (email	 sms text) by ba. after many attempts to find a solution	 it unfortunately turned out that we could not contact any representative office in thailand. however	 we managed to talk to the customer services team in uk. she informed us that due to the connecting flight from lhr to lis was cancelled by ba	 the airline had removed our names from the entire trip ( sectors). the assistant informed us that it was possible for our names to be added back to the bkk > lhr flight if we (by ourselves) could find a connecting flight from lhr to lis. the only solution is either this as explain or to accept a refund of our tickets. unfortunately	 there were no flight available on that day and that left us with only one choice - to accept the refund to our tickets (without offering any other help). our intention is to seek for proper explanation from ba in regards to how is it possible that there is no official communication/notification in regards to the flight being canceled to the passengers. we had to figure out the situation ourselves after an attempt to check-in online  hours before the flight. if we had went to check-in counter directly on our departure date	 we would be without a solution and our whole trip might be cancelled. we were in a roller coaster of emotions over the issue since we had less than  hours to find alternative solution from a problem that was not caused by us but bas neglect in providing proper communication to the passengers. finally	 we left no choice but to book last minute tickets from another airline which we had to pay % extra since it was a last minute ticket on christmas eve. i find it inexcusable for a world-class airline to neglect last minute communication to guests on one of the most important day & holiday of the entire year. this event had caused us not only an extra charge in our entire trips spending	 but left us with one of the worst flying experiences. we chose british airways in hopes of a seamless and stress-free travel experience but was given no notifications or any alternative help.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | i have flown british airways numerous times over many years. sadly the experience has deteriorated significantly recently and this flight was particularly poor. the staff were offhand and one seemed particularly unhappy to be there. the person next to me and i asked for the beef choice but were told that there was none left - too little had apparently been loaded. there was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choice. we asked for the fish. after some delay we were given our meals but found we had both been given a vegetarian meal. i had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice - no apology. eventually we received the fish which by then was dry and not enjoyable. we were asked for breakfast choices and gave in cards which stated we wanted a light choice  minutes before landing. we were not given anything. the service was really poor - and as usual the business seats were falling behind the quality and comfort found in other airlines. ba will really have to improve their product to continue to attract premium passengers.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | british airways have seriously gone downhill. there is absolutely no difference between them and low cost airlines - i would actually prefer easyjet and ryanair as at least they are transparent. this journey from lyon to london heathrow was chaotic and stressful. thanks to ba charging  to check in luggage one way	 every passenger takes cabin baggage. this means everyone flocks to queue up like cattle well before any announcements are even made. the boarding process made more unpleasant by them calling different groups out - i have honestly never seen anything like it. once on board	 they had to stow a lot of luggage in the hold as it couldnt fit. passengers were arguing with one another ( separate fights were witnessed) and staff were being very aggressive shoving bags and coats in every nook and cranny and telling people to move. the meal service is a joke - a pathetic barely edible sandwich. as always with ba flights to and from lhr	 this flight was late. we ended up flying round and round over london for  mins. the worst thing is bas new policy of charging to select a seat - even at online check in opening  hours before. this means they assign you any rubbish seat and you have to pay  just to change it to any normal seat (and even more if extra legroom). bas new policy seems to be to nickel and dime customers at every possible step of the way (and charge more than other airlines in the process). a shame they have turned this airline into something worse than low cost. i will definitely be avoiding them wherever possible.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | the usual shambolic unfolding that ba has now unfortunately been come to known for. we had a long weekend flight booked to munich that was supposed to be departing on th february at :. this happened to be our first flight with our newborn ( month old) daughter. it turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. just under hrs before scheduled departure	 the original th february flight was cancelled. we received an email as we were boarding the heathrow express. id booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. we ended up getting doing a round trip to paddington instead. on the way back from the cancelled flight	 both me and my wife tried calling ba. despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there)	 i took us nearly  minutes to speak to someone who could help. i believe ba outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. the result is that you might as well be speaking to an ai rather than a human. we often received the response similar to computer says no. if this is the service level for silver members i cant imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. when the phone originally connected to a person	 i had to wait  minutes as his computer booted up. - ba then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. our original flight was to munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to salzburg. when asking the robot at the ba call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location km apart	 they couldnt understand my frustration. eventually	 someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at :. not ideal as id wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldnt refund us or move our booking	 but at least we were going to munich and not salzburg. - the day of the new flight came round and	 this time	 we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. upon arriving at the check in desk	 we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled  minutes earlier. no email. no text. no notification ever arrived from ba to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. the check in person said i should get on the app to rebook. at this point	 i didnt know whether to explode with anger or cry. luckily	 another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. we were booked onto another flight later that evening (: - ba). unfortunately	 that meant hrs in the grotty lounge with a  month old baby. it appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so theres really no difference between the lounge and a hostel	 other than you get free stuff in the former. this was not a pleasant experience. we did eventually arrive in munich and	 despite asking	 didnt get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. the plane was a characteristically ba dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. all in all	 another shocking ba service. a lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees i interacted with.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | flew london gatwick to tampa. ba club world (business class) is a great way to travel. unfortunately due to renovations at lgw	 british airways are having to utilise a lounge so it wasnt as restful as may otherwise have been but once complete im sure that standard will be resumed. on boarding it was nice to be welcomed back	 a small but nice touch. straight after settling into our seats came complimentary drinks	 warm towels and our menu choices. ba does a great filet steak and the desserts were fantastic. one of the things i really love about ba is the fact that they have a diverse age range when it comes to their cabin crew. the more senior members really do know their stuff - the things that only experience gives you and this flight was no exception. superb service was provided by the cabin crew and even when stretching my legs they were quick to offer refreshments and guide me to the galley where a large selection of snacks/ drinks are available between the regular drink/meal service. the only downsides for me are the seating arrangement that means that those in window or centre seats have to step over other passengers when those passengers are fully reclined and the ife which really does need an update. i know that the second point is being addressed on the older aircraft. as an aviation enthusiast	 a really big thing for me is that the flight deck crew are always ready to spend some time chatting after the flight. ba! my airline of choice,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | gatwick to barcelona. unimpressed with the new m&s on board service. boarding process badly organised and the cabin crew cabin bags (quite a few) were in the overhead compartment and it took ages for all the passengers to place their bags overhead. i had to put my bag much behind my row. its not point to fly with them anymore as their service is just like budget airlines	 but sadly i booked my tickets before the announcement of buy onboard.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | sofia to belfast via london. the legroom on the sofia to heathrow flight was terrible. i am not tall	 but my knees were pushing against the seat in front. service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices. where did the service go? there was a bad delay on the belfast flight. we were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault	 as we had gone through security. only after  minutes were we allowed to re-enter the lounge. service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what ba was sending us via texts. the delay lasted  hours  minutes	 just short enough to avoid compensation. the belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the -hour flight from sofia. i will never set foot on this airline again.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,tate is not masculine	 hes very feminine. he talks very loudly and emotionally	 has a very effeminate voice and mannerisms. and very ostentatious. he supports traditional values to an extent	 but he himself is not traditionally masculine. im not even a tate hater and i dont even mean this as an insult	 its just strange that people always say tate is hyper-masculine traditional masculine like no	 hes not. hes too loud. traditional masculine is like calm	 collected	 unemotional	 logical (as opposed to emotional and conspiratorial)	 quietly supporting your family	 polite	 serious. like a general. stoic. tate is not that at all,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,piers casually floating the loverboy method as if it deserves to be an actionable felony -- as if its anything but weak	 rank	 transparent	 exploitative	 man-hating bullshit	 is offensive in the extreme. piers really shows his abject gullibility and cluelessness here. hes part of the old guard	 one of the millions and millions of men who is just dying to be used and abused by women and by the powers that be. piers is a part of the matrix trying to pretend not to be part of the matrix.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,palestinians since around  tried to make peace possible	 they accepted % of historical land of palestine according to  un decision and hamas will accept this	 if the israeli side admit of palestinian right of exist and have their own state (israel even doesnt admit that there is palestinian people. when someone denies you you denies him). so hamas will accept if there is an admit of israeli side of palestinians rights and state. but there is no will from the usa and israeli side to apply this! and thats clear	 because there are literally thousands of un decisions that should be applied	 but none of them applied literally!!! and thats the responsibility of the countries in power to apply it	 not the palestinians that should be blamed about; palestinians arr not in power and control!!!!,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,piers: points at his mistake,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,i think when piers brought up andrews misogynistic take on providing for the women he is with so that they can be his wife as a job (paraphrased)	 it would have been a better move to transition the conversation to  this tweet only applies to a select few of women. instead	 we witness andrew and piers going back and forth on the better for all women	 when really the conversation would have been more productive(imo) if andrew had clarified that his tweet would probably only affect a certain group of women.  every human being on this planet will always be different	 so to generalize what women want( to have a job	 or to be provided for) is unfair for both sides and is why they spent ish minutes discussing... semantics :(,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | very good flight back to london from barbados. bridgetown	 barbados is a small airport but the ground staff are very friendly and efficient and the exec lounge is good with reasonable snacks given the time of day (mid-late afternoon) and a decent selection of drinks available. aircraft was clean and it looked as if the club world cabin had recently received some tlc. entertainment system was excellent with a good choice of movies and very clear screen	 no doubt part of the overall attention the cabin seemed to have been given. bar service was good and the food was tasty	 good portion sizes	 the cheesecake for dessert was almost too much. being a night flight the crew got the bar and food service completed early in the flight allowing passengers to get some sleep before the lights came back up for breakfast. breakfast was good. cabin crew were excellent	 friendly and efficient. cockpit crew were clear and concise with their comms at the start and end of the trip. previous flights i have taken from lgw have shown a noticable difference in the cabin interiors compared to flights form lhr so it was good to see the lgw fleet getting some needed enhancements.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,our flight from london to boston was okay. disappointed to only be able to sit in middle of row of . annoying to have to pay extra to have a window seat. also catering on board is disappointing with only one meal plus a biscuit but crew were friendly and helpful. the return flight was different. staff not particularly helpful. person in front reclined seat fully and i wasnt able to fit food tray in. crew member said i was causing problems for the man in front when i requested he put his seat up to eat. also armrests did not lift up leaving less than  inches between seat in front and armrest meaning i was literally trapped in my seat for  hours. not comfortable and unsafe in an emergency. we had one drinks trolley followed by a meal around an hour later. staff then disappeared and only water or juice available for rest of flight. will not use ba again. delta and virgin flights offer much better service.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | washington to frankfurt via london. check-in at dulles airport was smooth. i asked the agent if it was possible to get a window seat and she did	 even though at the online check-in there was none available. boeing - was  years old	 the ife was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly bad. the seats were ok	 pretty standard but they had a head rest which was good. my seat was a and i had the whole row for myself. unfortunately a crew member shortly before take-off told me that another passenger had issues with his ife and they would replace him on c. shortly after take-off the service began. there were  food options available. chicken and vegatarian lasagne	 i went for the lasagne which was ok	 nothing special. it came with a salad	 a bread bun and a black forest cake. all in all an ok meal	 nothing to complain about. the crew distributed  mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying. after dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep. i tried to watch some movies (the selection was ok) which was hard on this miniature ife. in the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small water bottle. connecting in heathrow is pretty easy (in t) there are signs everywhere! security went fast. there is a huge quiet zone with battery chargers and free wifi. we boarded again in groups which was good to avoid crowds. ba started to do a buy-on-board service which i hate. however i thought the pricing was ok.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,very satisfactory flight with british airways from london to bangkok. was expecting the worst having read some of the reviews on here. i had one of the window seats where you dont have to climb over somebody to get out and this seat compared favourably with some of the higher ranked airlines as it offers excellent privacy. everything from check in to departure was seamless and apart from the avod which is pretty dated everything else on board was very satisfactory.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | this was really a no frills business class. this flight was part of trip with qatar airways. unfortunately	 the london to doha was operated by british airways. the seat is cramped and really outdated compared to the other major airlines. the ife was really poor with old screen system and poor range of options. the meal was not good related to the price you have to pay. the fas were really dull	 nothing wrong but no effort to communicate with passengers like fas from other airlines. ba really need to refresh or renovate their business class cabin. it might be excellent innovation back in mid s but the industry has moved on.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | philadelphia to edinburgh via heathrow in january . ive always enjoyed flying british airways and usually make my yearly trips to philly with them rather than flying direct to newark via united. the long haul flight was ok - food service was a wee bit slow but it was the usual chicken and rice which was ok for an economy class flight. however	 it was a surprise to me that they no longer served breakfast or even a snack in the morning - so the chicken was the only food we got on the flight. i wasnt too fussed about that	 until i got on my connecting flight to edinburgh where i found out that they no longer served free food! by this point	 i was pretty hungry so i caved in and got ready to pay for a bacon roll	 which never happened because the trolly never reached me! to top it all off	 we left heathrow late because of a computer problem	 meaning i missed my train connection in edinburgh - but i understand that these things happen at times. however	 recent cuts to service and the upcoming densification of the long and short haul fleet make ba a lot less attractive. furthermore	 the headphone jack on my ife was loose so it was quite difficult to watch films during the flight	 which was disappointing. on the up side	 the staff both at the desk and during the flight were great as always. considering i got the flight for a good price	 it was ok. although i will definitely not be going out my way to fly ba and will just go for the cheapest or direct option in future. im indifferent in recommending flying with ba - if they suit you best	 then go ahead. but dont go out your way to fly them - if there are cheaper or direct options	 just go for them instead because there isnt anything particularly outstanding.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,piers is so fixated on wanting to call out alleged misogyny that hes coming off as ignorant. misogyny is the hatred of	 or contempt for women - would a man who hated women really want to give them every advantage possible to be the best wife & mother they could be	 alleviate their stress by ensuring they did not have to work	 etc. piers is grasping & doesnt even realize how ridiculous he begins to sound. and then for him to imply that this viewpoint could have something to do with the criminal allegations...even if andrew tate was a misogynist	 which i do not believe he is	 is piers saying that misogyny itself is a criminal act? piers absolutely does not come into this interview with an open mind - but once again	 andrew tate destroys him & his arguments	 despite piers attempting to not let him get a word in.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,we just flew round trip on the new a from lax to lhr (and then on to rome). the a business class area was nice and the food was decent. however the layout of the seats wasnt great (you have to jump over the person next to you when they have their seat in a flat position). also avoid the aisle seats as you feel like youre out in the open and people are constantly bustling by. as well the seats on the aisle have zero storage space so you are constantly getting up to get things out of the storage bin above you or losing them under your seat. the ba lounge in lax was ok nothing great (although the food was decent) and their south lounge in lhr terminal  was just ok - very busy and crammed with people. nowhere to relax and enjoy some downtime. the food was the worst weve ever experienced in a lounge (only things available were horrible little sandwiches a few cookies and drinks. since lhr is the hub for ba we expected way more. however our biggest issue was with the staff on board the flights. they were highly erratic in quality. some were very friendly and helpful others were beyond rude. i had read that british air now has a new system where the same staff does not do the same routes on a consistent basis. there are apparently a lot of floaters who come and go and work different flights by choice. to me this seems like a big mistake and most likely causes the huge discrepancy in service. our flight home was an hour late (ba seems to be late a lot based on the many reviews). they also managed to lose all of our luggage. we travel a lot and will no longer choose british airways as its too much of a russian roulette as to whether your service will be good or not.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | los angeles to rome via london with british airways. our flight from lax to rome was on time and generally good. we upgraded from economy to premium economy at the airport for $ each. we had tried to upgrade ahead of time with our frequent flyer points but could not because we booked through costco (costco said we needed to go thru ba and ba said we had to go thru costco). boarding was not well organized. our flight from london was delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go as the airport departures board did not list a gate and departure time kept changing. one ba associate told us it would probably leave from gate  which proved to be incorrect information. we finally asked an attendant at a random gate who looked it up on her ipad. we had to sprint back to gate  with  minutes until departure. when we arrived at that gate	 we were told we would be bussed to our gate. we waited another  minutes for buses. seats were fairly comfortable. food was just okay - the small steak served was over cooked and as hard as rock. we arrived in rome almost  hours late. coming home we traveled economy as we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there was not a good value. our flight from rome to london was late in arriving which made us almost an hour late taking off from rome. boarding was chaotic and you couldnt understand the announcements being made about who was to board and when. other people were turned back rather rudely by ba staff. everyone seemed confused. snack on board was small but tasty. we had to be express serviced through security in london in order to catch our connecting flight. no time to catch a snack or use the toilet. boarding was in-process when we arrived at the gate. then we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take off. seats were very narrow and close together to the point that when the person in front of you reclined their seat	 the back of the seat was very close to your face. you had to go horizontalin order to get in and out of the seat to use the rest room. arm rests between seats and at the end of the row did not lift up entirely so you had to slide over the arm rests. food was pretty good. on board entertainment was good. service was slow	 forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of you. our luggage is on an extended vacation as it did not make it to our flight in london. we arrived  minutes late to lax. i also take exception to the $ luggage charge per leg of the trip for our nd bag. st bag is no charge but $ (round trip) charge for the nd bag is very steep.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | london to athens. since i started using ba in 	 i can only say that the quality becomes worse. the leg room in business class in a is the same like in economy. the only thing that you get is an empty middle seat. the meal choices are poor: i had to choose between curry and fish pie. also	 they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after - mins (once we ate the starter)	 they took the starter plate and they gave us the main. the on board service	 is less attentive than some years ago (probably cabin crew are over-utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable). also	 due to the plane being late	 the cabin was not cleaned properly. at some point we need to think why would someone choose ba over low cost airlines. tickets are priced in a similar way	 there is no food on board for the economy (while for business the portion and variety are a joke)	 leg space is small	 there are always delays to depart from heathrow (not bas fault	 but at the end of the day i experience delays). what is that makes ba in european flights distinct? probably nothing.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,flew lhr to denver colorado on // - // for a ski holiday. absolutely disappointed and outraged at the rubbish food served on both flights and obviously what i consider as edible and what ba class as edible we shall truly disagree on - awful food. coffee rubbish asked for more water and never got any? the inflight entertainment was also poor and a film was stopped after  minutes to reboot the system for other passengers. the male stewards were fine and happy but one of the female stewardesses was miserable and we felt we were putting her out asking for a drink which never arrived anyway? thought ba had got rid of that superior lucky to fly with us attitude! will not fly them again if i can help it.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | chicago to amsterdam via london club world / club europe. after a very nice first flight from tampa to chicago with my wife and our  months old baby	 transit in chicago was really smooth. our stroller was delivered at the gate and with a stroller there was a special bus to transfer us to the other terminal. we did not have to pass security a second time	 so we arrived very soon in a crowded business lounge. as a gold member i checked the first lounge	 but ground staff did not welcome me because it was crowded too. we found a quiet dinner part of the business lounge	 were seated by a very nice ground staff who offered me a glass of champagne to relax. food was decent. boarding the upper deck of this boeing - was a pleasure with a csd welcoming us by name. flight was excellent: food amazing	 enough cold drinks were offered	 cabin crew looking after us and our baby. our baby was playing all the time	 singing and talking his own words. after this perfect flight	 transit in lhr terminal was again relaxing. stroller was again waiting for us at the gate	 very nice. after security we went to the first lounge which was really was crowded	 but we found a quiet place to sit. time for a shower	 breakfast and relax. last flight to amsterdam was in a full cabin	 nice and frriendly cabin crew. the only small remark we can find	 is that this last flight there was no stroller waiting for us	 but it arrived with our luggage.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,only two people died on jan  piers and both were trump supporters	 so stop parroting that shitty untrue democrat narrative that the  years sentence has anything to do with people dying	 it doesnt .. the two people that died then and there were ashley babbitt an unarmed trump supporter and a military veteran who got unjustly executed by police in cold blood and another guy (also trump supporter) who fell on the stairs and died when things got rowdy in the protest .. so get your facts straight ffs ... meanwhile there are at least + people who died as a direct result of the blm riots	 hundreds injured some with disabilities	 and + billions worth of damages	 the fact that there is even any comparison between the two events is utterly insane and delusional.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,flew lhr-bud  sep ba and return  sep ba  club europe. early morning flight from t so breakfast in lounge. usual assortment of cereals and fruit etc but limited selection of hot food (although the bacon roll was delicious). as is usually the case had to ask for champagne but staff happy to oblige and quickly brought it to our table. plenty of staff around and the whole lounge appeared to be kept tidy and clean. had to board via a bus and there was no preference given to business passengers. managed to get onto the bus first and got to seat without any problem. plane had been refitted with the new layout. beautiful cabin and the seats are lovely but gone is the extra leg room in club. big disappointment. it feels quite claustrophobic and then the person in front puts their seat back. not as nice a place to be compared to the old club section aesthetics notwithstanding. friendly crew plenty of champagne and a surprisingly good hot breakfast of omelette mushrooms bacon and sausage with hot bread. coffee still poor however. no ife apart from progress maps / information on small screen from ceiling. bud airport a disaster. no time at all to clear immigration but had to wait almost an hour for bags - priority tags didnt seem to make any difference. no aircon in bag collection and overcrowded with people waiting for bags. very uncomfortable and unpleasant. on return the lounge ba shares at bud is small with very limited selection of food and drinks but all quite acceptable. a short delay was posted at check in and gate changed but all in all no real problem. priority boarding worked well. same plane configuration on return. excellent crew up front on return too - plenty of smiles and chat. fas free with the booze and nuts. food was again a surprise - i had cod with a tandoori sauce and rice with cauliflower. very tasty. ba can be hit and miss but i thoroughly enjoyed both flights. a great soft product if they can maintain the standard but the new fit out is a disappointment.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | i wasnt going to bother reviewing this flight as i seem to be on a perpetual downer with ba but the airport experience convinced me otherwise. after having our flight class reduced from first to business	 then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in first to make up for the disappointment	 they then reneged on this. as it was a special anniversary it sucked. flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats	 at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only. trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats. unbelievable! the flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable. this meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food. the crew was great but what an earth is going on at ba	 they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time. i say this as the new club suites are great.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,i flew from los angeles to london with british airways	 who seem to be working hard to improve things. what i cannot understand is why they still have not updated their club world seating after so many years. even the us carriers offer superior seating these days. i dont get it - new british airways plane but same old seats. while they are fully flat and i slept well	 the main issues are having to step over other passengers as there is no direct aisle access and a lack of storage space and cubby holes around the seat. the cabin crew were mature	 professional	 and the csd introduced himself during the flight and seemed genuine. catering seems to have improved - i chose the beef for dinner and instead of the usual overcooked lump in a casserole dish it was cooked well and plated similar to what all first rate airlines do in business class these days. instead of the dreaded bacon roll for breakfast	 there were two hot egg dishes	 a toasted sandwich or a cold plate of meats and cheeses.      british airways ranking,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | abu dhabi to heathrow return. probably one of the worst flight/travel experiences me and my family have had to endure! from what was supposed to be a joyous occasion for us as a family taking our daughter to the uk to get settled into university turned into an experience that will make sure that we never fly british airways again. first when checking in in abu dhabi the flight was cancelled due to technical problems with their new boeing . of course flights get cancelled and we fully understand but what was rediculous was the total lack of communication. passengers stood around for hours with no one knowing what was going on	 eventually a check in clerk told the passengers to come back the next day at  am for check in. the actual flight time was :	 then the plane was delayed yet again. british airways staff were no where to be found! eventually a supposed british airways manager arrived. we then couldnt check in because the system was broken	 after an hour they decided to manually check us in and we were away to get our daughter settled in uni.! arriving at heathrow	 two hours to clear customs because they were short staffed. then on to collect bags only to find that my daughters bag for uni was missing	 apparently never made the flight and no one knows where it is. again no communication from british airways despite several calls to them each day and the crazy thing is that you have to repeat the story to every service centre person that answers the phone. sad thing is that in the move to uni she had packed a few sentimental items into her check in bag	 when we explained this to the ba phone operator	 she was told that was probably not the wisest decision. thank you ba for the great advice. now sitting on the plane returning to home to abu dhabi (same plane)  days later and the plane is delayed again due to hydraulic fluid leaking from the engine. great you found the leak! but a new plane all these problems! seriously british airways	 should you not test your new aircraft before you haul passengers around the world.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | recently flew a return trip with ba to miami onboard one of their a aircraft	 and what has happened to this airline! outbound flight delayed  hour once we had boarded due to a broken seatbelt which should have been spotted during turnaround. having flown the route several times on the  we were looking forward to trying the a. we were seated in row  which is the last row in the mid section just before the central galley area. from the moment we sat down there was a dreadful whine coming from the wall behind us! upon asking the crew if this would stop they said they it was the fridges in the galley and once the engines started we wouldnt hear it. this went on for  hours and the crew issued us ear plugs to wear and said that the noise was normal on all their a aircraft. the food was horrid and only a choice of  meals. i chose a curry which had no flavour and was incredibly greasy. the return flight was a different a which had the same awful noise but it did stop around  hours prior to arrival. the food on the return was as disgusting as on the outbound leg and as for the breakfast it consisted of a cold bagel type thing with one blob of cream cheese in the middle. the standards have dropped so far it is incredible. im certain if i sat in row  on emirates or the like i wouldnt be issued with ear plugs. im booked to miami once more in early 	 fortunately on a quiet  and after that i will no longer fly with ba.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | flew british airways to/from heathrow recently as first experience. have read a number of previous reviews commenting about the indifferent attitudes of cabin service. i absolutely agree	 and what a shame. but ba	 if you actually read some of these reviews	 you can actually retrain and improve our perceptions quickly. when boarding	 rather than just pointing to which aisle to begin walking down	 actually have your cabin staff positioned (even in economy!) to assist passengers struggling to load carry on baggage and to get seated and out of the way of others. many of us are unfamiliar with the somewhat different controls on the newer s. perhaps a handout as we board or a bit of cabin assistance? on long transatlantic flights	 cabin stewards disappear for at least - hours mid flight. perhaps an occasional trip down the cabin once every hour or two to ask if customers need anything? (or are they fearful of the extra work?).,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,london to newcastle. been a while since i last flew british airways	 sad to see the same old planes in use and now very much looking their age for domestic use. technical issues delayed departure	 normal sure	 but the noise the plane made on taxi lasted far too long and was slightly alarming and not the norm. seat pitch belongs on a dodgy charter not the national carrier surely? last time flown i got a nice sandwich and drink	 this time its small bag of crisps and juice? its time ba stopped taking its domestic (no competition routes) for granted and upgrade the fleet on short trips	 the numbers onboard justify a better level of service considering the extra fees now attached for checked in luggage versus just carry on	 puts me off using their long haul option with ever increasing fees whilst oil prices have been rock bottom for how long now? kudos to the pilot for landing in monsoon like conditions with very limited visibility - if only the aircraft quality matched their pilots!,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | london heathrow to edinburgh. boarding efficient. flight was full so passengers asked to volunteer to check in hand luggage. by doing so they would get priority boarding. i took up the offer	 too out my laptop and carried it on to the plane. the aircraft is only two months old and i was sat at the back of the plane -  f. i am sure ryanair have more room. british airways on this aircraft are offering an ultra low cost service under a cloak of legacy carrier legitimacy.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,los angeles - heathrow - los angeles over the holidays. club world is a perfectly fine business product. staff on both legs were very good getting the job done in a polite and friendly way. food again is pretty good and benefits from covering the basics well and not being overly fussy. portion sizes not huge but i dont need the calories anyway. plenty of drinks offered. an unexpected nice touch was when during the outbound night flight as the only passenger awake a crew member popped her head over asked if i was ok and if i would like a hot chocolate - and then went and made one. in terms of product this is not a million miles away from united business (both even have backwards-facing seats). however the ba cabin crew are in a class of their own and it feels like they know it which translates in to good service. uniteds intercontinental crews are a somewhat more eclectic group whose get-up-and-go appears to have got-up-and-gone. just like with the  the upstairs on the a has side storage which is useful. the upstairs front section bathrooms are also huge (and from the front section you can go up and down the stairs if that tickles your fancy). but downstairs is light and roomy. on return on dec  i was delayed at the gate at heathrow as staff fussed over various company passengers that needed to be accommodated. these company passengers - flight crew heading off on vacation - then unluckily sat next to me in club and behaved appallingly for  hours - drinking champagne constantly loudly talking all night and demanding a running commentary on the ins-and-outs of working the a from every crew member that passed. they acted like children who had never been on a plane before - and their taking selfies (that included me in the background!) all flight was mildly vexing. upshot? as long as ba doesnt stiff you by putting its staff on freebie upgrades next to you youll enjoy club world on the a.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,piers is soooo beta. he does not want to be a man.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,that was a waste of my time. tate spoke alot of nonsense on this one and is obviously biased against israel so could not offer anything constructive on this topic.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,human lives manner no manner the conflict !,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,tate is right about pressure cooker	   it amazes me why both countries cant just get along.   israel is not as nice as you think & so is the other side.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,not a lot of humility. just brash	 arrogant	 and ignorant.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,my first long haul flight with british airways for some years and what a mistake! i flew premium economy expecting it to be on par with its competitors especially lufthansa or virgin atlantic - not so at all. at the airport	 it took over  hour to check-in; there was no dedicated premium economy check in nor a premium economy boarding queue at the gate either; perhaps the plane would be a little special? no	 not at all	 it was an old boeing  that had been designed to maximise seats at the expense of comfort; the cramped space of the premium economy cabin with its -- seating was comparable to economy and was light years behind the modern and spaciousness of other airlines	 and sitting in a middle row seat meant you could not physically squeeze past the person next to you to the aisle unless you woke the person up or you took your chance to stand over them and hope you manoeuvred successfully. stupidly i had thought that competition would eliminate most differences between airlines. how wrong i was - avoid british airways on the hong kong route if you are flying on a boeing . my advise is to check the plane type before booking or you will suffer an expensive  hour flight reminiscent of over  years ago!,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,piers looks terrified,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,this dude is so jealous of andrew lmao,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,tate has bitcoin still,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,my message is to andrew tate,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,you have double standards and you put any words just to support your position,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,its interesting that piers says many times that hell come to the subject of israels atrocities but he never did. he remained focused on getting tate to say his position on hamas the whole time.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,he is truly a masculine  many women out there have provided for men yet claiming didnt get anything out of that women.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,youll never need to worry    piers as you dont have the guts to tell the truth like andrew does,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,i dont understand why people talk with pierce morgan	 hes not a journalist but a framer and manipulator.. and why interview tate about politics 	 he is not a politician..,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,he cant show his eyes because that would show that he is brainwashed himself.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,i am a very regular traveller with british airways	 and i am currently executive club gold/oneworld emerald. i have recently flown with a heap of other oneworld airlines and feel british airways service slipping rapidly. the crew are smiles when you enter the cabin	 but when you are served	 the smiles seem a bit absent	 and the service	 i would describe as passable. compared with cathay pacific where crew will approach the premier status customers with a full welcome (regardless of class) and give that extra special attention making you feel of value	 this is absent with british airways. still the flight was short and pleasant enough. i got exit seat and the legroom was very good	 not very good in the standard economy seat and being .m its a squeeze. but all that you need for a  hour flight.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,hamas is releasing israel hostage but israel is releasing palestine prisoners. look at those two statements,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,this interview shows how piers is really program by new world order sad to see i liked him for second now idk about this guy,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,it feels like to me	 piers prepares for his interviews by coming up with damning questions or questions that are designed to trap people into saying the wrong things. personally i feel like its a little scummy to operate under the pretence of wanting to catch people out by having them fall for ploys.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,one girl shot by a swat team member. one guy died from a heart attack....,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,sorry tate	 you actually not as smart as you think you are. the world does not work in absolutes... we teach this to our junior school kids!,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,hard to believe how many people watch this thinking andrew looked good and came out on top. if youre going to condemn the matrix for twists and lies and manipulation (of which they are all guilty of)	 at least be honest and straightforward enough to recognize obvious definitions and apply them. if he could just admit hamas committed an act of terror that could have spent the rest of the time criticizing israel and everyone would agree. but instead tate dodges the question like the matrix he claims to be against.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,its kinda crazy how right this guy is.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,piers lost his credibility for the sake of pleasing his bosses and keeping the money coming in  as he speaks now thousands of innocent women and children are under the rubble. piers only care about children	 women and grandmothers only if they are not palestinians. life should be equal.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,the way this guy sounds	 it seems to me hes guilty!,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,andrew makes sense in the % of the interview	 piers is just an influential simp,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,verified review | dallas ft worth to mumbai via london heathrow after a reroute due to lufthansa strike. overall british airways business class product is not up to par with competitors and feels like a premium economy experience. ground staff at dfw were ok though there was no agent in the lounge till about  hours before departure. on board the seat if flat	 but very narrow. food was awful and felt like an economy class meal served on china; no flair and was unimaginative at best. crew on both flights were fairly mediocre - just went through the motions but didnt seem particularly interested in passenger service at all.the second meal on lhr-bom was the worst meal i have had on an airplane - literally a deep fried potato and thats it. lounge at lhr was unimpressive and overly crowded with minimal food selection- sad display for their main hub. overall i would not fly on ba by choice given their mediocre product. the still have  seat across in business compared with  on af	 aa and ua.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | london to tokyo haneda. my wife and i treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to japan with the help of my avios and a ba amex companion voucher. we were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated check-in area at heathrow was great. we boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint. we had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. the cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. the food and alcoholic drinks were great. i went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. i was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the ife. my wife and i both said afterwards that it didnt feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably. my only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,hes comitted that israel build this bunker under the hospital !!!!!!!,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,piers is being purposefully ridiculous. piers is penalising tate for being a traditional man. yes there is a new man theres a new world coming and piers is trying to dislocate traditional original position of man to whats now being defined as a man today. there are two different kinds of man and piers as being totally disingenuous to pretend that there is no place for the traditional man within new woke man. piers is awoke promoter and is being so disingenuous that he pretends that even tates position within the family has been disqualified and is worth nothing. this interview is totally biased towards the woke man who frankly does not resemble gods meaning of man at all. its been cruel and unkind. if the internet got turned off tomorrow piers morgan would dissolve into the real world because he wouldnt be capable of looking after a family. piers would be annihilated in two seconds.,Misc,
SocialMediaUser,UserComment,how about the failure of israeli secret services	 morgan? people are not stupid	 morgan! please dont insult our intelligence	 media people... media people didnt talk about the innocent people of palestina before  october. im not a big fan of andrew	 but hes right. the problem between israel and gaza had to be solved for a long time. what happened on october  is terrible	 and monstrous	 but this is the consequence of the political stupidity of the great powers. if we were to talk about whose fault it is	 it is the fault of those who have watched with indifference what happened in gaza until now. did you just hear about gaza and israel issues?,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,trip verified | i really enjoyed my flight from london to johannesburg. the aircraft was very comfortable and the crew were friendly and polite. in inflight entertainment had a wide selection. the food was ok but nothing to get excited about	 i did eat all of it though. as i have grown older i have found long haul flights less tolerable so i was not really looking forward to this flight	 however i was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely use british airways on that route again.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,piers assumption that women will be offended by hearing a man say he believes in traditional family values is hilarious. im sure some will disagree with tates views	 but most of the women i know are happy stay at home moms and housewives. to each their own	 but im disgusted by the push for women to feel like they should either do it all or be ashamed because they are only a housewife.,Misc,

SocialMediaUser,UserComment,piers your style for this interview was very rude and arrogant . you dont have to like andrew but as a guest theres a level of respect and that means if someone politely says he doesnt wish to share  personal  info about his family read the play and drop the question . i dont agree with everything andrew says but he is clearly a lot  more intelligent than you piers . andrew is correct in everything he said about the lockdown	  vaccine effectiveness and the covet money heist . theres not alot of players his age that wouldnt have at least one disgruntled ex wanting their  mjnutes of fame even if it ment lying about it . that to me says he dates quality women and he is an honest  and fair man which should be promoted . i wonder could you survive that scrutiny ?   i think your jealous of his intelligence if nothing else 	 he held his ground with yet another attack on him as he usually does . its not your best work thats for sure . more power to him,Misc,
